371,371,the reason to investigate the bfkl and dglap equations in the case of supersymmetric theories is based on common belief that the high symmetry may significantly simplify the structure of these equations indeed it was found in the leading logarithmic approximation that the so called quasi partonic operators in sym are unified in supermultiplets with anomalous dimensions obtained from universal anomalous dimensions by shifting its arguments by an integer number further the anomalous dimension matrices for twist operators are fixed by the superconformal calculations in the maximally extended sym where the coupling constant is not renormalized give even more remarkable results namely it turns out that here all twist operators enter in the same multiplet their anomalous dimension matrix is fixed completely by the super conformal invariance and its universal anomalous dimension in lla is proportional to which means that the evolution equations for the matrix elements of quasi partonic operators in the multicolor limit are equivalent to the schrödinger equation for an integrable heisenberg spin in qcd the integrability remains only in small sector of the quasi partonic in the case of sym the equations for other sets of operators are also evolution equations for quasi partonic operators are written in an explicitly super conformal form in ,"['anomalous dimension matrices for twist-2 operators', 'anomalous dimension matrix', 'anomalous dimensions obtained from universal anomalous dimensions γuni(j) by shifting its arguments by an integer number', 'Calculations in the maximally extended N=4 SYM, where the coupling constant is not renormalized', 'Evolution equations for quasi-partonic operators', 'evolution equations for the matrix elements of quasi-partonic operators in the multicolor limit Nc→∞', 'fixed by the superconformal invariance', 'high symmetry may significantly simplify the structure of these equations', 'investigate the BFKL and DGLAP equations in the case of supersymmetric theories', 'leading logarithmic approximation', 'LLA', 'N=4 SYM', 'super-conformal invariance', 'twist-2 operators']",O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 
372,372,remarkthe purely radiative spacetimes used as reference solutions in our analysis are not perturbations of the minkowski spacetime way of seeing this is to consider the newman penrose constants of the spacetime the newman penrose constants are set of absolutely conserved quantities defined as integrals of certain components of the weyl tensor and the maxwell fields over cuts of for the einstein maxwell case it has been shown that the value of the newman penrose constants for vacuum radiative spacetime coincides with the value of the rescaled weyl spinor at result can be extended to the electrovacuum case using the methods of this article for the radiative spacetimes arising from the construction it can be seen that the value of the weyl spinor at is essentially the mass quadrupole of the seed static spacetime it follows that the newman penrose constants of the radiative spacetime can take arbitrary values on the other hand for the minkowski spacetime the newman penrose constants are exactly zero and those of perturbations thereof will be small thus in this precise sense our radiative spacetimes are generically not perturbations of the minkowski spacetime unless all the newman penrose constants ,"['Maxwell fields', 'Minkowski spacetime', 'Newman–Penrose constants', 'radiative spacetime', 'radiative spacetimes', 'reference solutions', 'vacuum radiative spacetime', 'Weyl tensor']",O O B I O O B I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

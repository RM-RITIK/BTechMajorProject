2,2,"The first-principles calculations are performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) [21] which implements the plane-wave pseudopotential DFT method. The exchange correlation functional is approximated using the generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) [22], and the electron–ion interactions are described by Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotentials [23]. The plane wave basis set is truncated at a cutoff of 400eV, and the Brillouin-zone sampling was performed using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme with a k-point spacing in reciprocal space of 0.04Å−1. Tests show that these computational parameters give results that are sufficiently accurate for present purposes. The ferromagnetism of nickel is accounted for by performing all calculations using spin polarization, starting at a ferromagnetic initial configuration and relaxing towards its ground state. However, for all compositions considered, the ground state electronic structure of each alloy is found to exhibit only very weak ferromagnetism, and the effect is not thought to influence their phase stability. Table 1 shows the calculated equilibrium lattice constants of the η phase at various Ti concentrations, using partially ordered ηP structures. The change in lattice constant upon Ti alloying is relatively small, but can be related to the ∼10% larger covalent radius of Ti. The calculated lattice constants are in good agreement with the experimental values, which relate to an alloy with a Al/Ti ratio of ∼2.75.

3,3,"Microhardness can be related to other macroscopic mechanical properties such as yield stress, σ, and elastic modulus, E, both derived from compression testing. For work-hardened metals, Tabor derived a direct proportionality between hardness and compressive yield stress: H≈3σ [20]. However, it was soon realized that Tabor's relationship only applies to materials that exhibit full plasticity [9,10]. Deviations from this relationship have been reported for a number of metals, glasses and polymers where the elastic strains are non-negligible [9]. Hence, the different expressions describing the correlation of hardness with conventional macroscopic mechanical properties rely on the validity of the above-mentioned elasto-plastic models. In this way, hardness and yield stress no longer hold direct proportionality but their relationship depends on the specific material properties, such as Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus [9,11–13]. It has been shown that these elasto-plastic models not only satisfactorily explain an H/σ ratio of ≈2 for a number of polyethylene materials of different nature, but also theoretically account for the range of H/E ratios experimentally determined [21].

5,5,"Nuclear theory devoted major efforts since 4 decades to describe thermalization in nuclear reactions, predominantly using semi-classical methods  [13,14,10], in line with similar problems in quantum liquids  [15,16]. There were attempts to develop improved molecular dynamics methods combining quantum features with a semi classical treatment of dynamical correlations  [17,18]. Still, no clear-cut quantum approach is readily available yet, in spite of numerous formal attempts [19,20,10]. The field of clusters and nano structures is far younger but fast developing in relation to the ongoing developments of lasers and imaging techniques. Semiclassical approaches were also considered in the field to include some dynamical corrections  [21,22] and could qualitatively describe dynamical processes. But such approaches are bound to simple metals with sufficiently delocalized wave functions, and thus smooth potentials justifying semiclassical approximations. The case of organic systems, in particular the much celebrated C60   [4,23], cannot be treated this way. Semi classical, and even classical approaches, can be used at very high excitations such as delivered by very intense laser pulses  [2]. In such cases the system is blown up and details of its quantum mechanical features do not matter anymore. But for less violent scenarios, quantum shell effects cannot be ignored.

6,6,"We use open and close aperture Z-scan experiments, in analogy to the saturation absorption work discussed earlier in water [8], to respectively measure the β and n2 for a series of primary alcohols with the help of 1560nm femtosecond laser pulses, however, with the important inclusion of an optical-chopper. The vibrational combination states of the alcohols are coupled by the femtosecond laser pulses at 1560nm. These couplings result in the absorption of 1560nm and the excited molecules undergo relaxation through non-radiative processes, which gives rise to transient thermal effects. These transient thermal effects are related to the pure optical nonlinearity of the samples and can be measured as a change in their n2 values [14]. The transient thermal effects of individual pulses accumulate in case of high repetition-rate lasers to produce a cumulative thermal effect at longer timescales. We measure this cumulative thermal effect with the mode-mismatched two-color pump–probe experiment.

Section 2 considers the implications of the coupling between the spin of a classical electron and the rapidly varying electromagnetic field produced by a laser-driven plasma wave. Sufficiently short, high-intensity laser pulses can form longitudinal waves within the electron density of a plasma. These density waves propagate with speed comparable to the group speed of the laser pulse. Not all plasma electrons form this wave, however; some of the electrons are caught up in the wave and accelerated by its high fields. The wave eventually collapses as these electrons damp the wave (the wave ‘breaks’). The extremely high electric field gradient of a plasma wave near wavebreaking provides an excellent theoretical testing ground for the effects of Stern–Gerlach-type contributions to the trajectory of a test electron.

8,8,"In summary, we have developed a technique for site-specific nanowire size reduction by FIB thinning. Transmission electron microscope images of a thinned tungsten composite nanowire with width reduced from 80 to 20nm show uniform shrinking along the length of the wire and high resolution images show no obvious changes of the morphology after thinning. The critical current density of the as-deposited wire and one thinned to a width of 50nm is 1.7×105 and 1.4×105A/cm2 at 4.26K, respectively, suggesting insignificant modulation of the electrical properties during thinning.

9,9,"Under these experimental conditions, the observed dynamics has to occur where the probe laser induces the reactions resulting in further ionization [30]. The two-step decay model [26] was applied to explain the above-mentioned fragmentation of DCPD to CPD, shown in Figure 8a. The fitting of the rise and decay components of the transients were done by Matlab® programming using the curve fitting Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. The best fit decay constants for the biexponential decay components of C10H12+ ion signal is τ1=35fs and τ2=240fs, while that for C5H6+ ion signal is τ1=36fs and τ2=280fs, respectively. These decay constants conform to the previously reported time constants of norbornene and norbornadiene [22,23]. The transients of the reaction fragment C5H6+ are sufficiently different from that of the parent ion C10H12+ indicating that we are studying the distinct dynamics of the neutrals and not that of the parent ion fragmentation [24]. Applying laser control principles under such experimental circumstances also confirms that we are controlling the product yield of C5H6+, resulting from the photochemical reaction of DCPD.

10,10,"The control of the RP re-encounter probability finds a direct application to improve the performance of chemical devices. Here, we show how a simple-to-implement control scheme highly enhances the sensitivity of a model chemical magnetometer by up to two orders of magnitude. The basic idea behind a chemical magnetometer is that, since a change in the magnetic field modifies the amount of singlet products, one can reverse the reasoning and measure the chemical yield to estimate B. Intuitively, the magnetic sensitivity is high when a small change in the magnetic field intensity produces large effects on the singlet yield. Formally, it is defined as:(2)Λs(B)≡∂Φs(B)∂B=∫0∞pre(t)gs(B,t)dt,with gs(B,t)≡∂fs(B,t)∂B being the instantaneous magnetic sensitivity. The functional form of fs(B,t)=Sρel(t)S strongly depends on the specific realization of the radical pair, in particular on the number of the surrounding nuclear spins. Here, we consider a radical pair in which the first electron spin is devoid of hyperfine interactions, while the second electron spin interacts isotropically with one spin-1 nucleus, e.g. nitrogen. In the context of the chemical compass (i.e. when the task is determining the magnetic field direction through anisotropic hyperfine interactions), an analogous configuration (with only one spin-1/2 nucleus) has been proposed [3], and numerically characterized [8], as being optimal: Additional nuclear spins would perturb the intuitive ‘reference and probe’ picture. The Hamiltonian then simplifies to H=-γeB(S1(z)+S2(z))+|γe|αS→2·I→, where α is the isotropic hyperfine coupling.

However, significant reaction barriers (0.593–1.118 eV) for the O2 molecule on the cluster are identified on different adsorption sites, nevertheless, these reaction paths are spin forbidden reactions according to Wingerʼs spin selection rule. These results imply that O2 readily desorb from the cluster surface rather than dissociate and oxide the W@Si12 cluster upon excitations.

12,12,"As discussed above, proper inclusion of these interactions requires segment synchronization after every iteration. In order to minimize simulation errors due to incorrect values of the interactions potential, segments are synchronized after every iteration. Although relatively long communication times between remote processors may hinder this process in typical parallel computers, this is not the case for GPGPU architectures. Still, full recalculation of the interaction potential after each iteration is time consuming. Instead, the algorithm corrects the current potential by adding dipole contributions for every nearby charge that hopped during the previous iteration. Full updates of the interaction potential are only required for the grid points that are related to charges that hopped during the last iteration. Accumulative rounding errors that arise due to repetitive addition and subtraction are solve this by rounding all interaction potentials to a uniformly spaced range of floating point numbers.

The profile lengths extracted from the images were then used to modify the length of the sample and therefore the surface area. Table 1 shows the original oxide thicknesses after 111 days oxidation, the modified oxide thicknesses based on the surface profile length and the percentage difference. Results show a maximum decrease in the oxide thickness of 4% when using a surface which accounts for roughness. Comparing the change in oxide thickness between different surface finishes indicates a variation of less than 1%. As such, the impact of the variation in the profile length on the calculated oxide thickness is considered to be insignificant. In addition, if the differences in weight gain were only due to differences in surface area, rougher samples would be expected to demonstrate thicker oxides at the earliest stages of oxidation.

15,15,"Hydrides, once precipitated in zirconium, degrade the mechanical properties of a component, leading to reductions in tensile strength, ductility and fracture toughness [35–40]. These changes can ultimately compromise the integrity of cladding during normal operating life , accident conditions and fuel storage [13]. As well as the degradation of mechanical properties, the presence of hydrides can also affect phenomena like pellet cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI); or introduce mechanisms for failure, such as delayed hydride cracking (DHC). The former mechanism is the product of thermal expansion in fuel pellets introducing stresses into the cladding, which may then lead to the formation of cracks in areas made brittle by large hydride concentrations [13]. The latter mechanism, DHC, is a sub-critical, time dependent cracking phenomenon that requires long range hydrogen diffusion for repeated local hydride growth and fracture at a hydrostatic tensile stress raiser [5,41,42]. The process occurs over an extended period of time under a continuously applied load that is below the yield stress of the material [5,41,42].

16,16,"In exploring the WKB limit of quantum theory, Bohm [2] was the first to notice that although one starts with all the ambiguities about the nature of a quantum system, the first order approximation fits the ordinary classical ontology. By that we mean that the real part of the Schrödinger equation under polar decomposition of the wave function becomes the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation in the limit where terms involving ℏ are neglected. In contrast to this approach, in this Letter we show that the classical trajectories arise from a short-time quantum propagator when terms of O(Δt2) can be neglected. This fact was actually already observed by Holland some twenty years ago: In page 269 of his book [6] infinitesimal time intervals are considered whose sequence constructs a finite path. It is shown that along each segment the motion is classical (negligible quantum potential), and that it follows that the quantum path may be decomposed into a sequence of segments along each of which the classical action is a minimum. The novel contribution of the present Letter is an improved proof of Hollandʼs result using an improved version of the propagator due to Makri and Miller [9,10].

The intensity of the TFM image ITFM at any point (x,z) is given by:(10)ITFM(x,z)=|∑HTR(1c((xT−x)2+z2+(xR−x)2+z2))|forallT,Rwhere HTR(t) is the Hilbert transform of a signal uTR(t) in the FMC data, xT is the x-position of the transmitting element (T) and xR is the x-position of the receiving element (R). Note that the z-position of all elements is zero (Fig. 3a). The summation is carried out for all possible transmitter–receiver pairs and therefore uses all the information captured with FMC. This algorithm is referred to as ‘conventional TFM’ in this paper.

18,18,"The need for power generation industry to improve the thermal efficiency of power plant has led to the development of 9–12% Cr martensitic steels. The development of and research on P91 steels started since late 1970s and early 1990s, respectively [1]. The work has focussed on their creep strengths due to its intended application at high temperature. Recently, the introduction of more cyclic operation of power plant has introduced the possibility of fatigue problems. Bore cracking due to the effects of varying steam warming has been reported [2]. The temperature cycling causes thermal gradients between the inside and outside of components and this can cause cyclic stress levels to be of concerns. Recently, research on thermal–mechanical analysis of P91 has been carried out including the characterisation of the cyclic behaviour of the material using the two-layer and unified visco-plasticity models [3,4].

19,19,"The presence of chaotic motion in nuclear systems has been firmly related with the statistics of high-lying energy levels [8,9]. Poisson distributions of normalized spacings of successive nuclear or atomic excited levels with the same spin and parity correspond to integrable classical dynamics, while Wigner's statistics signal chaotic motion in the corresponding classical regime [10]. Intermediate situations are more difficult to assess. Very recently a proposal has been made to treat the spectral fluctuations δn as discrete time series [11]. Defining (1)δn=∫−∞En+1ρ˜(E)dE−n, with ρ˜(E) the mean level density which allows the mapping to dimensionless levels with unitary average level density, and analyzing the energy fluctuations as a discrete time series, they found that nuclear power spectra behave like 1f noise, postulating that this might be a characteristic signature of generic quantum chaotic systems. In the present work we implement this idea, using the 1f spectral behavior as a test for the presence of chaos in nuclear mass errors.

20,20,"Inspired by energy-fueled phenomena such as cortical cytoskeleton flows [46,45,32] during biological morphogenesis, the theory of active polar viscous gels has been developed [37,33]. The theory models the continuum, macroscopic mechanics of a collection of uniaxial active agents, embedded in a viscous bulk medium, in which internal stresses are induced due to dissipation of energy [41,58]. The energy-consuming uniaxial polar agents constituting the gel are modeled as unit vectors. The average of unit vectors in a small local volume at each point defines the macroscopic directionality of the agents and is described by a polarization field. The polarization field is governed by an equation of motion accounting for energy consumption and for the strain rate in the fluid. The relationship between the strain rate and the stress in the fluid is provided by a constitutive equation that accounts for anisotropic, polar agents and consumption of energy. These equations, along with conservation of momentum, provide a continuum hydrodynamic description modeling active polar viscous gels as an energy consuming, anisotropic, non-Newtonian fluid [37,33,32,41]. The resulting partial differential equations governing the hydrodynamics of active polar viscous gels are, however, in general analytically intractable.

However, these were discarded after review as unsuitable.

22,22,"The dynamics of various physical phenomena, such as the movement of pendulums, planets, or water waves can be described in a variational framework. The development of variational principles for classical mechanics traces back to Euler, Lagrange, and Hamilton; an overview of this history can be found in [1,19]. This approach allows to express all the dynamics of a system in a single functional – the Lagrangian – which is an action integral. Hamiltonian mechanics is a reformulation of Lagrangian mechanics which provides a convenient framework to study the symmetry properties of a system. This is expressed by Noether's theorem which establishes the direct connection between the symmetry properties of Hamiltonian systems and conservation laws. When one approximates the system numerically, it is advantageous to preserve the Hamiltonian structure also at the discrete level. Given that Hamiltonian systems are abundant in nature, their numerical approximation is therefore a topic of significant relevance.

The O2 flow rate (QO2) was keep constant at 99sccm, while the SF6 flow rate (QSF6) was varied between 0 and 20sccm. The pressure in the etch chamber was controlled to keep the gas density stable. Since the pressure has a pronounced effect on etch characteristics, the pressure (p) was varied between 20 and 40mTorr. It should be noted that the system was run in automatic pressure control mode, which continuously adjusts the throttle valve to keep a constant pressure during etch. The coil power (PC) was fixed at 1000W, while the bias power (PB) was varied between 0 and 30W. Finally, the substrate chuck temperature (T) was controlled between 10 and 50°C. This design resulted in a full factorial screening in four parameters, where three center points were used to check for quadratic curvature, where the quadratic term of a parameter is needed to generate a valid model. The total number of experiments in this setup is 19, which were processed for 20min each. The experiments in the design were carried out in random order.

Evidence has been reported in recent years that the pyridinyl radical (PyH) is an exceptionally strong reducing agent which can even reduce CO2 to formaldehyde, formic acid or methanol with suitable catalyzers [27–29], albeit the mechanisms of these reactions are currently poorly understood [30–32]. The theoretically predicted dissociation thresholds of the AcH, AOH and BAH radicals are about 2.7eV, 2.5eV and 3.0eV, respectively (see Fig. 4), while the predicted dissociation threshold of the pyridinyl radical is much lower, about 1.7eV [1]. Pyridinyl is thus a significantly stronger reductant than acridinyl and related radicals. It is therefore not expected that the latter will be able to reduce carbon dioxide in dark reactions.

26,26,"Progressive photon mapping was first proposed by Hachisuka et al. (2008) as an iterative extension of the standard static photon mapping approach as implemented in the Radiance extension. It combines multiple smaller photon maps to approximate a much larger one which may not fit into memory using the traditional approach. Through iteration, the process mitigates the noise inherent in Monte Carlo raytracing by combining successive results and averaging them. At the same time, the density estimate bandwidth1Bandwidth describes the support, or area of influence, of a filter used to weight the photons retrieved from the photon map during a nearest neighbour lookup on a surface (Jensen, 2001). The resulting irradiance is proportional to the photon density, and the bandwidth is defined by the distance (radius) to the furthest photon found. In this paper, we generalise the term to describe either the radius or the number of nearest neighbours for a density estimate, depending on the implementation.1 (radius or number of nearest photons) is gradually reduced to mitigate bias. As Hachisuka points out, the accumulated density estimates converge to an unbiased solution in the limit.

This is the premise of the Quark–Meson Coupling (QMC) model [9] which has been used successfully to calculate the properties of nuclear matter as well as finite nuclei [10,11].

The present work is confined to relaxation mechanisms which result from changes in normal stresses. More specifically, we are interested in the local mechanisms of irreversible energy loss caused by uniform compression or expansion of a medium for which all components remain unchanged, rather than the losses caused by friction between different layers of a medium which move with different velocities (for a more detailed discussion of this issue see [26]). No attempt is made to model effects of shear viscosity and heat conduction beyond the conventional Navier–Stokes approach, since this topic goes far beyond the scope of this paper.

31,31,"Traditionally, archaeologists have recorded sites and artefacts via a combination of ordinary still photographs, 2D line drawings and occasional cross-sections. Given these constraints, the attractions of 3D models have been obvious for some time, with digital photogrammetry and laser scanners offering two well-known methods for data capture at close range (e.g. Bates et al., 2010; Hess and Robson, 2010). The highest specification laser scanners still boast better positional accuracy and greater true colour fidelity than SfM–MVS methods (James and Robson, 2012), but the latter produce very good quality models nonetheless and have many unique selling points. Unlike traditional digital photogrammetry, little or no prior control of camera position is necessary, and unlike laser scanning, no major equipment costs or setup are involved. However, the key attraction of SfM–MVS is that the required input can be taken by anyone with a digital camera and modest prior training about the required number and overlap of photographs. A whole series of traditional bottlenecks are thereby removed from the recording process and large numbers of archaeological landscapes, sites or artefacts can now be captured rapidly, in the field, in the laboratory or in the museum.

32,32,"It is well known that one of the long standing problems in physics is understanding the confinement physics from first principles. Hence the challenge is to develop analytical approaches which provide valuable insight and theoretical guidance. According to this viewpoint, an effective theory in which confining potentials are obtained as a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance has been developed [1]. In particular, it was shown that a such theory relies on a scale-invariant Lagrangian of the type [2] (1)L=14w2−12w−FμνaFaμν, where Fμνa=∂μAνa−∂νAμa+gfabcAμbAνc, and w is not a fundamental field but rather is a function of 4-index field strength, that is, (2)w=εμναβ∂μAναβ. The Aναβ equation of motion leads to (3)εμναβ∂βw−−FγδaFaγδ=0, which is then integrated to (4)w=−FμνaFaμν+M. It is easy to verify that the Aaμ equation of motion leads us to (5)∇μFaμν+MFaμν−FαβbFbαβ=0. It is worth stressing at this stage that the above equation can be obtained from the effective Lagrangian (6)Leff=−14FμνaFaμν+M2−FμνaFaμν. Spherically symmetric solutions of Eq. (5) display, even in the Abelian case, a Coulomb piece and a confining part. Also, the quantum theory calculation of the static energy between two charges displays the same behavior [1]. It is well known that the square root part describes string like solutions [3,4].

33,33,"Following fission, noble gas atoms will be distributed in the fuel matrix initially accommodated at point defects trap sites, generally thought to be Schottky trivacancy defects [4,5,31]. Diffusion to either bubbles or grain boundaries is then facilitated by associating a further uranium vacancy defect for the gas atom to ‘hop’ into, with the original vacancy then able to loop around to ensure continued diffusion. The rate determining step in the process is not the migration of the Xe itself but rather the rearrangement of the VU defect to facilitate net Xe diffusion [6–8]. Activation energies for the overall process depend on the availability of the defect trap sites, which in turn depends on the crystal stoichiometry. For Xe diffusion in UO2−x, UO2 and UO2+x the activation energies calculated using DFT are 7.04–12.92 eV, 4.15–7.88 eV and 1.38–4.07 eV with the ranges reflecting the way the calculations were performed depending on the charge states of the defects involved and the presence of a Jahn–Teller distortion [7]. Activation energies calculated using empirical pair potentials can vary strongly depending on the choice of potential. Govers et al. examined three different potentials for UO2 (those of Basak [9], Jackson [10] and Morelon [11]) coupled with different parameterisations for the U–Xe and O–Xe interactions from Geng [12] and Nicoll [13] and recommend values of 6.5 eV, 4.5 eV and 2.4 eV [6] for the different stoichiometric regimes in very good agreement with the experimental values of 6.0 eV, 3.9 eV and 1.7 eV respectively [14].

34,34,"A living polymerization is a reaction without transfer and termination reactions that can proceed up to complete monomer conversion. In addition, when initiation is quantitative and fast compared to the propagation reaction, polymers with precisely controlled chain length and narrow molar mass distribution can be obtained. In the case of an industrial styrene polymerization this would permit to avoid any specific washing or degassing steps, which are necessary in the radical process to remove residual monomer and low molar mass oligomers. Since head-to-head defects along the chains are absent, anionic polystyrene would exhibit also a better thermal stability than radical one. Therefore, production of anionic polystyrene (PS) would be of interest if the conditions required to control the polymerization could be adapted to the market and be able to compete economically with industrial radical processes. The use of organic solvents and of expensive alkyllithium initiators, as well as the relatively low reaction temperatures required, was some important limitation to overcome. The possibilities to achieve a quantitative living-like anionic polymerization of styrene in the absence of solvent and at elevated temperature, using inexpensive initiating systems, were the main targets identified to tremendously decrease the cost of the anionic process. This implied at first to control the reactivity and stability of initiating and propagating active species in such unusual operating conditions.

35,35,"The homologous series of n-alkanes are represented here as homonuclear chains of tangent Mie spherical CG segments. The development of CG models for long n-alkanes such as n-decane (n-C10H22) and n-eicosane (n-C20H42) has already been successfully demonstrated using the SAFT-γ Mie formalism [118]. The n-decane molecule was represented by chains of three and n-eicosane chains of six fully flexible tangentially bonded Mie segments. A certain degree of parameter degeneracy in terms of overall performance is expected as a consequence of the conformal nature of the EOS description [132]. In our current work, we use an alternative CG mapping for n-alkanes developed in reference [122], where each segment was taken to represent three alkyl carbon backbone atoms and their corresponding hydrogen atoms. By applying this mapping, n-alkanes chains containing multiples of three carbon units can be represented directly: n-C6H14, n-C9H20, n-C12H26, n-C15H32, n-C18H38, etc. A good description of the thermodynamic properties of these alkanes is found to be provided with CG alkyl beads characterised by the Mie (15–6) potential. For convenience, the exponent pair (15–6) is also used to represent the interactions between the CG beads of the intervening alkanes considered here; the number of segments m is taken to be the nearest integer of the division of the carbon number C by three. The size σ and energy ∊ parameters are then estimated from the experimental saturated-liquid density and vapour pressure of the individual alkanes following the usual SAFT-γ Mie procedure. The chosen mapping is by no means unique, as one can postulate parameter sets that fulfil other requisites, such as being “universal” across the entire homologous series [119] or correlated to the critical properties [125].

36,36,"Algorithms regarding distance fields go back to the level set equation. The level set method was presented by Osher and Sethian [20] who described the temporal propagation of moving interfaces by numerical methods solving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. This is performed by a finite difference scheme working on a rectangular grid in two or three dimensions. Information on normal vectors and curvature can be obtained. The fast marching method [21] provides an efficient numerical scheme of complexity nlogn to compute the support values on the grid. It is a reinterpretation of the propagation process, i.e. the time where the interface passes a certain grid point is influenced only by those neighboring grid points which are previously passed by the interface. An overview on the theory of level set and fast marching methods and their applications to problems of various areas are given in [22,23], for example shape offsetting, computing distances, photolithography development, seismic travel times, etc. Distance fields are a special case of the level set equation where the absolute value of the advection velocity is 1.

A comprehensive list of applications can be found in  [8]. The IBM is both a mathematical formulation and a numerical scheme for fluid–structure interaction problems. As mentioned above, in a classical fluid–structure interaction problem, the fluid and the structure are considered separately and then coupled together via some suitable jump conditions. In the IBM however, the structure–which is usually immersed in a Newtonian fluid–is viewed as being part of the surrounding fluid. This means that only a single equation of motion needs to be solved (i.e. a one-phase formulation). Additionally, the IBM allows the immersed structure to move freely over the underlying fluid mesh, alleviating the need for the remeshing required in a classical formulation.

38,38,"In order for DLS based micro-rheology to be successful, there must be sufficient scattering contrast between the sample and the tracer particles. In order to achieve this, the maximum possible concentration of tracer particles was added such that single scattering events still dominated (as determined by measurements of diffusion coefficients in water at different concentrations). In order to determine whether or not the background scattering from the sample was sufficiently low compared to that of the tracer particles, we also compared the scattering intensities obtained from samples with and without tracer particles as a function of time. The results of this exercise are shown in Fig. 6. From this figure it can be seen that although initially the scattering from the sample without tracer particles is low compared to those containing tracer particles, as gelation proceeds this eventually ceases to be the case. This is presumably because of the development of supra-molecular structures, such as those seen previously (Fig. 2B). Based on the results in Fig. 6 it was decided to only use data collected in the first 240min of the experiment, after which point the scattering from the gel network became rather too large to ignore.

If we are prepared to allow that the process is driven by a CRG and that the MAP model that we have discovered is indeed generating the idle process, then identifying the disconnected components of the system allows us to immediately make assertions about the impact of various controls we might apply to this regulatory process – just as we can were we to believe the model was a causal extension of a BN. In the context of microarrays, the objective of clustering is to identify patterns among the data and decide which genes to focus on in further, more gene-specific, experiments. It is therefore necessary for the scientist to make such causal conjectures about the effect of controls available to her on the expressions reflecting the underlying regulatory process she studies. These conjectures can be universal or nuanced by evoking ideas of parsimony.

41,41,"A multi-physics description of a multiscale system is often referred to as a ‘hybrid’ model. In fluid dynamics, a typical hybrid combines a molecular treatment (a ‘micro’ model) with a continuum-fluid one (a ‘macro’ model), with the aim of obtaining the accuracy of the former with the efficiency of the latter [1–4]. The micro and macro models generally have characteristic timescales that are very different, which means that time-accurate simulations can be extremely challenging: the size of the timestep required to make the micro model stable and accurate is so small that simulations over significant macro-scale time periods are intractable. If the system is ‘scale-separated’, a physical (as distinct from numerical) approximation can be made that enables the coupled models to advance at different rates (asynchronously) with negligible penalty on macro-scale accuracy. E et al. [5] were the first to introduce and implement this concept in a time-stepping method for coupled systems, referred to in the classification of Lockerby et al. [6] as a continuous asynchronous (CA) scheme (‘continuous’ since the micro and macro models advance without interruption [5]). In this paper we extend this idea to multiscale systems comprising an arbitrary number of coupled models.

42,42,"Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is a numerical simulation method which is directly based on the NURBS-based representation of CAD models. It exploits the tensor-product structure of 2- or 3-dimensional NURBS objects to parameterize the physical domain. Hence the physical domain is parameterized with respect to a rectangle or to a cube. Consequently, singularly parameterized NURBS surfaces and NURBS volumes are needed in order to represent non-quadrangular or non-hexahedral domains without splitting, thereby producing a very compact and convenient representation.The Galerkin projection introduces finite-dimensional spaces of test functions in the weak formulation of partial differential equations. In particular, the test functions used in isogeometric analysis are obtained by composing the inverse of the domain parameterization with the NURBS basis functions. In the case of singular parameterizations, however, some of the resulting test functions do not necessarily fulfill the required regularity properties. Consequently, numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations cannot be applied properly.We discuss the regularity properties of the test functions. For one- and two-dimensional domains we consider several important classes of singularities of NURBS parameterizations. For specific cases we derive additional conditions which guarantee the regularity of the test functions. In addition we present a modification scheme for the discretized function space in case of insufficient regularity. It is also shown how these results can be applied for computational domains in higher dimensions that can be parameterized via sweeping.

We used experimental rates of light neutral mesons and resonances where available (Table 1) for normalization purposes. The uncertainty introduced by the JETSET parameter settings (which amounts to 20% at most) affects only the production of the η′ and ϕ for which no experimental data are available.

45,45,"The mentioned difficulties associated with the calibration process inspired the concept of inverse modelling. In this case, the experimental data become entirely integrated in the calibration process and an optimization routine is used to quantify the best set of parameters which explain the observed pyrolysis behaviour (i.e. multivariable curve fitting). The most used experimental data for model calibration have been the mass loss rate and the surface temperature [10–12]. The optimization technique used is function of the number of variables and their interactions. In the past, only the few most uncertain parameters (i.e. the kinetics parameters) were generally used as potentiometers [13]. However, sophisticated mathematical procedures have been developed to increase the number of parameters optimized simultaneously (e.g. Genetic Algorithm (GA) [10,14] or Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) [11]). Lautenberger and Fernandez-Pello [12] have recently investigated the influence that the choice of algorithm can have on the optimized parameters. They generated using their code GPYRO a set of synthetic data (mass loss rate and surfaces temperature) and tried with different algorithms to find back the set of input parameters. The four optimization algorithms provided results with an absolute average error between 1% and 25%. SCE was the most suitable algorithm. The use of synthetic data conveniently avoids the problem of agreement between the actual physical phenomena and any modelling assumption.

46,46,"Although the presented model is developed and tested with a-C:H layers in mind, it is not necessarily limited to them. Moreover, the only assumptions are chemical reactions between the gas and the solid forming volatiles, the loss of these volatiles from the material and the two stated boundary conditions of gas influx at a single outer surface and the possibility of reactions throughout the bulk. Porosity and significant gas inventories were observed not only for carbon [12] but, e.g. also for beryllium co-deposits [25] and can be expected for other co-deposits formed in plasma devices [1]. Thus, TCR and its description by the presented model may be applicable to all deposits. If a layer has constituents that are not forming volatiles with the reactive gas, e.g. W and Be with O2, these constituents cannot be removed by TCR, as they will not be removed from the deposit. This can influence the removal of other deposit constituents and the time evolution of the process can change. The new understanding of TCR may, for the first time, allow applying the method in a controlled way to nuclear fusion devices, possibly solving the tritium retention issue especially related to carbon based materials.

47,47,"When dominated by surface shadowing mechanisms, the aggregation of vapor particles onto a surface is a complex, non-local phenomenon. In the literature, there have been many attempts to analyze the growth mechanism by means of pure geometrical considerations; i.e., by assuming that vapor particles arrive at the film surface along a single angular direction [38,41]. Continuum approaches, which are based on the fact that the geometrical features of the film (i.e., the nanocolumns) are much larger than the typical size of an atom [42,266,267], have been also explored. For instance, Poxson et al. [228] developed an analytic model that takes into account geometrical factors as well as surface diffusion. This model accurately predicted the porosity and deposition rate of thin films using a single input parameter related to the cross-sectional area of the nanocolumns, the volume of material and the thickness of the film. Moreover, in Ref. [39], an analytical semi-empirical model was presented to quantitatively describe the aggregation of columnar structures by means of a single parameter dubbed the fan angle. This material-dependent quantity can be experimentally obtained by performing deposition at normal incidence on an imprinted groove seeded substrate, and then measuring the increase in column diameter with film thickness. This model was tested under various conditions [40], which returned good results and an accurate prediction of the relation between the incident angle of the deposition flux and the tilt angle of the columns for several materials.

48,48,"Complex Langevin (CL) dynamics  [1,2] provides an approach to circumvent the sign problem in numerical simulations of lattice field theories with a complex Boltzmann weight, since it does not rely on importance sampling. In recent years a number of stimulating results has been obtained in the context of nonzero chemical potential, in both lower and four-dimensional field theories with a severe sign problem in the thermodynamic limit  [3–8] (for two recent reviews, see e.g. Refs.  [9,10]). However, as has been known since shortly after its inception, correct results are not guaranteed  [11–16]. This calls for an improved understanding, relying on the combination of analytical and numerical insight. In the recent past, the important role played by the properties of the real and positive probability distribution in the complexified configuration space, which is effectively sampled during the Langevin process, has been clarified  [17,18]. An important conclusion was that this distribution should be sufficiently localised in order for CL to yield valid results. Importantly, this insight has recently also led to promising results in nonabelian gauge theories, with the implementation of SL(N,C) gauge cooling  [8,10].

50,50,"Historically, the interest in accurate measurement of DNI started decades ago. Early studies (e.g., Linke, 1931; Linke and Ulmitz, 1940) identified the difficulty of separating the measurement of DNI from that of the diffuse irradiance in the immediate vicinity of the sun, hereafter referred to as circumsolar irradiance. Pastiels (1959) conducted a detailed study of the geometry of pyrheliometers, and how that geometry interacted with circumsolar radiance, using simplified representations of the latter. Various communications were then presented at a WMO Task Group meeting held in Belgium in 1966 (WMO, 1967) to improve the accuracy of pyrheliometric measurements, including estimates of the circumsolar enhancement. Ångström (1961) and Ångström and Rohde (1966) later contributed to the same topic, followed years later by Major (1973, 1980). The whole issue of instrument geometry vs. circumsolar irradiance was complex and confusing at the time because different makes and models of instruments had differing geometries. This was considerably simplified after WMO issued guidelines about the recommended geometry of pyrheliometers, which led to a relatively “standard” geometry used in all recent instruments. The experimental issues related to the measurement of DNI are discussed in Section 3.2.

51,51,"Brodsky and Lepage [8] have proposed a formula for meson pair production which looks similar to (25), except for a different charge factor and the appearance of the timelike electromagnetic meson form factor instead of the annihilation form factor R(s). This formula was obtained from the leading-twist result by neglecting part of the amplitudes with opposite photon helicities. As has been pointed out in [9], this part is however not approximately independent of the pion distribution amplitude and not generically small. We also remark that the appearance of Fπ(s) in the γγ→π+π− amplitude is no longer observed if corrections from partonic transverse momentum in the hard scattering process are taken into account, and that these corrections are not numerically small for the values of s we are dealing with [13]. Notice further that two-photon annihilation produces two pions in a C-even state, whereas the electromagnetic form factor projects on the C-odd state of a pion pair. In contrast, our annihilation form factor R2π(s) is C-even as discussed after (24). Finally, due to a particular charge factor, the Brodsky–Lepage formula leads to a vanishing cross section for γγ annihilation into pairs of neutral pseudoscalars.

52,52,"It has recently been demonstrated [15] (see also [13] and references therein) that for a self-dual background the two-loop QED effective action takes a remarkably simple form that is very similar to the one-loop action in the same background. There are expectations that this similarity persists at higher loops, and therefore there should be some remarkable structure encoded in the all-loop effective action for gauge theories. In the supersymmetric case, one has to replace the requirement of self-duality by that of relaxed super self-duality [16] in order to arrive at conclusions similar to those given in [15]. Further progress in this direction may be achieved through the analysis of N=2 covariant supergraphs. Finally, we believe that the results of this Letter may be helpful in the context of the conjectured correspondence [17–19] between the D3-brane action in AdS5×S5 and the low-energy action for N=4 SU(N) SYM on its Coulomb branch, with the gauge group SU(N) spontaneously broken to SU(N−1)×U(1).

53,53,"Ever since the identification of the paramagnetic E′ centre in SiO2 as an unpaired electron localised in an sp3 hybrid orbital of an Si atom backbonded to three oxygen atoms, a number of attempts has been made at explaining the optical and electronic properties of SiO2 in the presence of E′ centres. The irradiation or hole injection induces trapping of positive charge in thin layers of a-SiO2 grown on silicon surfaces by thermal oxidation. This effect has been correlated with paramagnetic E′ centre signals and led to the initial assignment of the neutral oxygen vacancy as the major hole trap in a-SiO2 [1–3]. In this model, originally proposed for E′ centres in α-quartz, upon trapping a hole, one Si atom from the two Si atoms constituting the vacancy remains neutral and hosts the localised unpaired electron while its counterpart becomes positively charged. Although this model has initially been accepted widely for its simplicity, it fails to account for a number of observations, such as the positive charge trapping without generation of E′ centres [4], the formation of high density of E′ centres without the corresponding density of positive charge [5], and the absence of correlation between the decrease of the E′ centre density and the density of positive charge upon post-irradiation electron injection in SiO2 [6].

54,54,"The next important step might be the derivation of the Dirac equation. The Creutz model  [32] suggests that we should consider incorporating into the logical inference treatment, the additional knowledge that one has objects hopping on a lattice instead of particles moving in a space-time continuum. Recall that up to Section  2.4, the description of the measurement scenario, robustness etc. is explicitly discrete. In Section  2.4, the continuum limit was taken only because our aim was to derive the Pauli equation, which is formulated in continuum space-time. Of course, the description of the motion of the particle in Section  2.6 is entirely within a continuum description but there is no fundamental obstacle to replace this treatment by a proper treatment of objects hopping on a lattice. Therefore it seems plausible that the logical inference approach can be extended to describe massless spin-1/2 particles moving in continuum space-time by considering the continuum limit of the corresponding lattice model. An in-depth, general treatment of this problem is beyond the scope of the present paper and we therefore leave this interesting problem for future research.

For systems that exhibit strong intermolecular interactions, this approximation often leads to poor agreement between experiment and theory. A striking example is purine [18], where a study of the solid state vibrational spectra by isolated molecule and periodic calculations, gave almost quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for the latter, whereas the former gave only modest agreement and was unable to distinguish between the tautomers. In the present case, where the structure consists of ions linked by hydrogen bonds, periodic calculations based on the complete primitive cell are essential [19]. The only work [20] that includes some solid state effects used molecular dynamics but from which it is difficult to extract assignments.

56,56,"According to the ellipsometric spectra, optical constants and other physical parameters can be extracted by an appropriate fitting model. In order to estimate the optical constants/dielectric functions of Ni-doped TiO2 films, a three-phase layered system (air/film/substrate) [15] was utilized to study the ellipsometric spectra. TiO2 belongs to the wide band gap semiconductors. Considering the contribution of the M0 type critical point with the lowest three dimensions, its dielectric function can be calculated by Adachi's model [15,22,23]: ε(Ε)=ε∞+{A0[2−(1+χ0)1/2−(1−χ0)1/2]}/(EOBG2/3χ02). In the model, E is the incident photon energy, ε∞ is the high-frequency dielectric constant, χ0=(E+iΓ), EOBG is the optical gap energy, and A0 and Γ are the strength and broadening parameters of the EOBG transition, respectively. As an example, the experimental SE of the film TN1 at an incident angle 70° by dot scatter is shown in Fig. 4. The Fabry–Pérot interference oscillations due to multiple reflections within the film have been found in the photon energy from 1.5eV to 3.5eV (354nm–826nm), which indicates that the films are transparent in this region. Note that a good agreement of the experimental and calculated spectra is attained in the whole measured photon energy range.

57,57,"Recently, fundamental (thermophysical property) research on ionic clathrate hydrates has experienced remarkable growth, particularly over the last ten years [21–30]. Previously, beginning with the first paper on unusual hydrates of tetrabutylammonium salts in 1940 [31], a number of studies could be found on ionic clathrate hydrates (hereafter, semiclathrate hydrates) [32–35] before the unified terminology semiclathrate hydrate was generally accepted. Semiclathrate hydrates have been attracting increased attention because of their promising applications as phase change materials for refrigeration systems and in gas capture and storage [36–41]. In addition, there is interesting speculation that semiclathrate hydrate may be regarded as a representative substance for the study of thermal conductivity in clathrate hydrate in general. This is because: (1) it can reduce characterization problems as a solid sample, since semiclathrate hydrate is formed around ambient temperature under atmospheric pressure and is easy to handle; (2) accurately measuring the thermal conductivity of semiclathrate hydrates, which have many similarities to clathrate hydrates, may make possible a deeper understanding of the unique (anomalous) behavior of the thermal conductivity of clathrate hydrates; and (3) currently, there are no experimental studies on the thermal conductivity of semiclathrate hydrates.

Indeed, structure and elasticity are important parameters for elucidating grain boundary stability. All potential models correctly predict the relative stability of the defect energies. The Morelon potential model performed best as it was specifically derived to replicate defect formation energies, but it largely underestimates the bulk modulus. The energies calculated with the Morl and the Arima potential models are overestimated; this is a known disadvantage of using rigid ion models as the ionic polarisability is not taken into account. For completeness, we report two shell models with the best results given by the Catlow potential model. The Morl, along with the Grimes shell potential model, accurately reproduce the activation energy of oxygen migration (the migration path was the lowest energy and most favourable diffusion mechanism observed in bulk UO2 [1]). The major deficiency of the Morl potential is that the cation defect energies are high, and hence the number of cation defects will be underestimated. However, this should not be an issue unless this model was applied to processes such as grain growth where cation mobility will contribute.

59,59,"The main drawback of thermo-oxidation in most actual devices and ITER is its limitation to maintenance periods, when the vessel walls can be heated up around 300–400 °C by hot helium injection through the cooling system [19,20], and also because of the required reconditioning of the walls before plasma operation to remove the absorbed oxygen [10]. However, the temperature achieved is not homogeneous over the vessel, as it is limited to the distance to the cooling tubes, and thus to the device design. The analysis of this study is a continuation of previous works done for the treatment of ITER carbon co-deposits [1–3], so the temperatures studied are in the range of 350 °C for divertor and 200–275 °C for main wall and remote parts. At present, due to budget restrains as well as due to tritium trapped in co-deposited carbon layers, ITER will not use carbon materials at the divertor strike points in spite of their excellent resilience against large heat loads. Nevertheless, many present experimental nuclear fusion devices (DIII-D, TCV, etc.) and new ones (JT-60SA, KSTAR, Wenderstein-7X) use carbon elements, so the removal of carbon co-deposits is still necessary for a better device operation—plasma density control, dust events, etc. The temperatures used in this work are not very different from the ones achievable in present devices, such that the results can be extrapolated to them. Moreover, even for ITER this study could be useful if carbon materials have to be eventually installed in the case that operation with tungsten tiles at the strike points is precluded by unexpected reasons.

Therefore, we focus our attention on the D-flat directions. For D-flat directions, we have to be more careful since behaviors of the potential depend on which flat direction we consider. In the MSSM, Yukawa interactions exist in the superpotential to generate the fermion masses. Such Yukawa interactions lift some of the D-flat directions. In addition, we can also find several D-flat directions which are not affected by the Yukawa interactions associated with the fermion masses; without R-parity violation, such D-flat directions are only lifted by the effects of supersymmetry breaking.33Here, we assume that coefficients of non-renormalizable terms are suppressed enough to be neglected.

61,61,"By the early 1970s, and following the ‘golden age’ of general relativity that took place in the 1960s, there was a wide array of candidate theories of gravity in existence that could rival Einstein’s. A formalism was needed to deal with this great abundance of possibilities, and this was provided in the form of the Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism by Kenneth Nordtvedt, Kip Thorne and Clifford Will. The PPN formalism was built on the earlier work of Eddington and Dicke, and allowed for the numerous theories available at the time to be compared to cutting edge astrophysical observations such as lunar laser ranging, radio echo, and, in 1974, the Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar. The PPN formalism provided a clear structure within which one could compare and assess various theories, and has been the benchmark for how theories of gravity should be evaluated ever since.

62,62,"In all these studies, the association between the transition and lateral cracking in the oxide layer depicts some interaction between the mechanical behaviour of the system, and its corrosion kinetics, but does not provide a clear understanding of the morphology of the metal:oxide interface during the corrosion process, at the nanometre level. Understanding why this transition behaviour happens is critical when modelling the rate of growth of oxide, and therefore to the lifetime prediction of Zr clads, and ultimately to the safety of nuclear power reactors. No model will be complete without a nanoscale understanding of what is going on during oxidation. Thus, it is essential that the oxide scale and the top layers of the metal are studied at nanometre resolution to reveal the detailed structural and chemical changes associated with diffusion of oxygen and the resulting oxidation of the metal. Whilst a number of techniques have been employed for this purpose, it is clear that various techniques within transmission electron microscopy (TEM) will be among the most versatile and informative for this purpose, although additional information can be added by techniques such as atom probe tomography.

63,63,"There exist some interesting cases where the deformation structure becomes simple. One is the limit to the N=1/2 superspace [5], where the action should reduce to N=1/2 super-Yang–Mills theory with adjoint matter. Another interesting case is the singlet deformation [10,11], where the deformation parameters belongs to the singlet representation of the R-symmetry group SU(2)R. In this Letter, we will study N=2 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory in the harmonic superspace with singlet deformation. In this case, the gauge and supersymmetry transformations get correction linear in the deformation parameter. Therefore we can easily perform the field redefinition such that the component fields transform canonically under the gauge transformation. In the case of N=1/2 super-Yang–Mills theory, such field redefinition is also possible [5]. But in this case the component fields do not transform canonically under the deformed supersymmtery transformation. In the singlet case, we will show that there is a field redefinition such that the redefined fields also transform canonically under the deformed supersymmetry. We will construct a deformed Lagrangian which is invariant under both the gauge and supersymmetry transformations. We find that the deformed Lagrangian is characterized by a single function of an antiholomorphic scalar field.

65,65,"A surfactant is a surface active agent. In this work a surfactant term will be used for compounds which improve the dispersability of the CI in the acid (as emulsifiers providing dispersed emulsion – not separated) while wetting the surface of the metallic material [14,20,24]. However, surfactants can offer corrosion protection themselves. Some examples when the same compound was used as a surfactant or active corrosion inhibitor ingredient are given below. Typical surfactants in the oilfield services industry are alkylphenol ethoxylates, e.g. nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE) [14,15,30,106,107]. However, NPEs have been banned from use in the North Sea because of their toxicity. On the other hand, ethoxylated linear alcohols are more acceptable [20]. The quaternary ammonium salts and amines (when protonated) are the most used compounds of the cationic surfactants class, where the cation is the surface active specie. As the amines only function as a surfactant in the protonated state, they cannot be used at high pH. On the other hand, quaternary ammonium compounds, frequently abbreviated as “quats”, are not pH sensitive. Long-chain quaternary ammonium bromides were also reported to work as efficient CIs for steel materials [106]. A frequently employed surfactant was N-dodecylpyridinium bromide (DDPB) [9,60,61,108,109]. Anionic sulphates, anionic sulphonates, alkoxylated alkylphenol resins, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan oleates are also useful surfactants. Ali reported that a particularly useful surfactant is a blend of polyethylene glycol esters of fatty acids and ethoxylated alkylphenols [15].

66,66,"Our aim is to introduce vector mesons in terms of a Lagrangian which satisfies the low energy current algebra. One consistent method is in terms of a non-linear chiral Lagrangian with a hidden local symmetry [6]. In this theory the vector mesons emerge as dynamical vector mesons. The three point vector-pseudo scalar interaction is given by (11)ih4〈Vμ(P∂μP−∂μPP)〉, where h stands for the vector-pseudoscalar coupling. Some typical vertices of ρ's to pseudoscalar mesons are (12)π+(p1)π−(p2)ρ0:h(p1−p2)μεμ,π+(p1)π0(p2)ρ−:h(p1−p2)μεμ,K+(p1)K¯0(p2)ρ−:h2(p1−p2)μεμ,etc., which is directly related to the ρ decay width: Γ(ρ)=h2(|pπ|)3/(6πmρ2), where pπ is the momentum of final state pions in the ρ rest frame. With Γ(ρ)=149.2MeV, we find h=5.95. We note in passing that the Kawarabayashi–Suzuki–Riazuddin–Fayyazuddin relation gives the value h=mρ/(2fπ)[12]. Thus the value of h in Eq. (4) and the two values in this paragraph differ by small amounts (∼19%). The strong four-point vertices involving pions are obtained from the first two terms of Eq. (5). The weak vertices are obtained from the definitions of Q6 and Q8. In the numerical work we shall use the value of h from Eq. (4) and also h=5.95 obtained from the decay width.

It should be remembered that both phases were present already from start of the exposure. The data is presented in absorbance units and allows comparisons to be made of the amounts of each species between the two Cu40Zn surfaces investigated, DP and HZ7. The tendency is very clear that the formation rates of both hydrozincite and cuprite are quite suppressed for Cu40Zn with preformed hydrozincite (HZ7) compared to the diamond polished surface (DP). In summary, without being able to consider the formation of simonkolleite, it can be concluded that an increased surface coverage of hydrozincite reduces the initial spreading ability of the NaCl-containing droplets and thereby lowers the overall formation rate of hydrozincite and cuprite.

68,68,"Although the basic mechanisms of the AD process are reasonably well understood, it has not proved simple to apply existing theories to the interpretation of experimental data. What is needed is a combination of the AD theory and the electronic structure of realistic systems, including surface defects and adsorbed species. Such electronic structure calculations are still complex and time-consuming. In many cases, especially for insulating surfaces, attempts to model MIES spectra use simple or intuitive models. In Refs. [4,6,23] it is assumed that the main transition mechanism is Auger de-excitation, and the MIES spectra have been simulated by the surface density of states (DOS) projected on the surface oxygen ions of the uppermost surface layer using a Hartree–Fock method (the crystal code [24,25]) and a density functional theory (DFT) method (the cetep code [26]). The effect of the overlap between the surface and He(1s) wavefunctions was taken into account only approximately by applying an additional z-dependent exponential factor to the surface DOS. Other workers [5,6] estimated the AD transition probability using a DOS projected on to the projectile 1s atomic orbital. However, they were not able to use state-of-the-art methods for the surface electronic structure. Yet the success of the simplified treatments [4–6], especially for MIES features such as relative energies of the different peaks, suggests that real spectra are indeed related to the projection of the surface DOS on to the projectile orbital.

69,69,"I also could not resist mentioning another wild speculation [10]. Many years ago, inspired by the almost exact correspondence between Einstein's post-Newtonian equations of gravity and Maxwell's equations of motion I proposed the gravitipole in analogy with Dirac's magnetic monopole. After Dirac there was considerable debate on how a field theory of magnetic monopoles may be formulated. Eventually, 't Hooft and Polyakov showed that the magnetic monopole exists as an extended solution in certain non-abelian gauge theories. Most theorists now believe that electromagnetism is merely a piece of a grand unified theory and that magnetic monopoles exist. Might it not turn out that Einstein's theory is but a piece of a bigger theory and that gravitipoles exist? In grand unified theory the electromagnetic field is a component of a multiplet. Could it be that the gravitational field also somehow carries an internal index and that the field we observe is just a component of a multiplet? Throwing caution to the wind, I also asked in [10] if the gravitipole and the graviton might not form a representation under some dual group just as the magnetic monopole and the photon form a triplet under the dual group of Montonen and Olive [11].

70,70,"Structural adhesives are increasingly used for bonding components within critical load bearing engineering structures such as aerospace and automotives. Typically these adhesives are based on epoxy polymers. Epoxies are inherently brittle due to their homogeneous microstructure and highly cross linked nature. Thus, there has been much research focused on improving the fracture toughness of epoxy polymers by incorporating a second minority phase at the nano-scale. These modifiers fall into one of two main categories: inorganic additives, e.g. silica [1,2], glass [3], alumina [4], nano-clays [5] and carbon nanotubes [6,7] or organic, usually rubber particles. Rubbery additives can be either core–shell rubber particles [8–10] or can form during curing via reaction induced phase separation mechanisms [11,12]. The primary energy dissipation mechanisms for rubber toughened epoxies are known to be both plastic void growth and shear band development [13]. It has also been shown that a combination of the above additives to create a hybrid material can provide synergistic toughening effects, e.g. carbon nanotubes and silica nanoparticles [14] or rubber with silica nanoparticles [15–17].

[21] The Hamiltonian consists of a 1-dimensional tunnelling mode coupled to an (M−1)-dimensional harmonic bath, hence it is a system-bath problem which bears some similarity to the Caldeira-Leggett model of tunnelling in a dissipative system [22,23]. This Hamiltonian is non-dissipative, however and the harmonic modes all have the same frequency. System-bath models play an important role in physics, being used to describe superconductivity at a Josephson junction in a superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) [24], for which the Caldeira-Leggett model provides a theoretical basis, and magnetic and conductance phenomena in the spin-bath regime [25].

73,73,"Spark plasma sintering (SPS) is a relatively new sintering-based technique [17] in which the powder to be consolidated is loaded into an electrically and thermally conductive graphite mould and a large DC pulsed current (1000–5000A) is applied under a uniaxial pressure. When current passes through the graphite mould (and the powder if it is electrically conductive), the powder is heated both from the outside (the mould acts as a heating element) and inside (due to Joule heating from the intrinsic electrical resistance of the powder material). SPS is characterised by very fast heating (up to 2000°C/min) and cooling rates and short holding times (minutes) to achieve near theoretical density [17]. Thus SPS occupies a very different time–temperature–density space in powder consolidation maps when compared with conventional methods, such as hot pressing sintering and HIP with ramp rate of 50–80°C/min and a few hours holding time. Although SPS has been studied for a rapidly growing number of materials [17], there are only a small number of studies on the fabrication and microstructural characterisation of ODS steels processed by SPS, briefly reviewed below.

74,74,"Due to the complex nature of the thermal spray process, modelling has been playing a key role in providing some key insights for process design and operations. The relationships among processing conditions, particle characteristics, and the resulting coating properties are nonlinear and might be difficult to be unravelled by the experimental studies alone (e.g. [5–7]) Detailed information on the atomic level changes leading to changes observed at macroscale can appropriately be obtained by MD simulation and the effect of temperature and velocity can be determined more precisely. In this work, relatively simpler spray system of copper–copper particle was simulated to obtain a better understanding of particle recrystallization and solidification, and deformation mechanics and topography of the impacting particles. Using state-of-the-art methods to examine the physical mechanisms involved in the impacting behavior and structure–property relationship, it can be suggested that the consecutive layer deposition of particles can better be understood by understanding individual particle impacts. The particle–surface interaction mechanism and its relation to Reynolds number can offer information on the quality of the coating through its response to shock heating. As a general practice, engineering components are thermally sprayed in a continuous multilayer mode with cooling; therefore there is an opportunity for developing richer theoretical models for single or multiple particle impact in conjunction with actual spraying tests, so as to identify cohesive and adhesive strength, hardness and residual stresses.

76,76,"Prior to assembling the miniature ADR, the mKCC MR heat switch could not be fully thermally characterised due to cryostat constraints. However, based on experiments and research conducted at MSSL on a range of tungsten heat switches, the thermal conductivity has been estimated. In Hills et al. [8], an equation is derived which allows the thermal conductivity (κ) below 6K to be calculated as a function of magnetic field (B) and temperature (T) (see Eq. (1)). To estimate the performance of the mKCC heat switch, the parameters in Eq. (1) have been taken from the measured thermal conductivity of another MSSL heat switch with the same 1.5mm square cross section, a free path length of 43cm and a RRR of 20,000; it has been observed from experiments conducted at MSSL that there is little change in the thermal performance for tungsten heat switches with a RRR between 20,000 and 32,000 (subject of a future publication) and therefore the performance of the 20,000 RRR heat switch has been assumed to be a good approximation. Fig. 5 gives the calculated thermal conductivity of the mKCC switch at 0, 1, 2 and 3T based on Eq. (1), where the constants b0, a1, a2, a3, a4 and n have the values 0.0328, 1.19×10−4, 3.57×10−6, 1.36, 0.000968 and 1.7 respectively. It should be noted that the calculated thermal conductivity of the mKCC switch presented in Fig. 5 has been validated by comparing the experimental results of the miniature ADR with modelled predictions (this is discussed in Section 3.3).(1)κ(T)=b0T2+1a1+a2T2T+Bna3T+a4T4

In the conventional method to assay pollen tube growth, the pollen tubes grow in a disorderly manner on solid medium, rendering it impossible to observe their growth in detail. Here, we present a new method to assay pollen tube growth using poly-dimethylsiloxane microchannel device to isolate individual pollen tubes. The growth of the pollen tube is confined to the microchannel and to the same focal plane, allowing accurate microscopic observations. This methodology has the potential for analyses of pollen tube growth in microfluidic environments in response to chemical products and signaling molecules, which paves the way for various experiments on plant reproduction.

Approaches for extraction of the necessary information must be able to disregard spurious information, so as to develop a working network of models for each active mechanism related to each degradation pathway on the mesoscopic physical level and the data-driven statistical model level. To capture the temporal evolution of the energy material over long time frames, appropriate informatics methods are needed to balance data volume (e.g., simple univariate time-series data streams with high-dimensional volumetric imaging datasets) while considering their respective information contents [68,69]. The raw data and extracted information must be accessible for query and modeling. Similarly, the modeling approaches used to understand and parameterize active mechanisms and phenomena over lifetime fall into the broad categories of micro-, meso- and macroscopic approaches.

80,80,"Although the free Kelvin wave problem is of considerable theoretical importance, problems with forcing and damping have greater practical importance. In nature, the forcing could be due to a wind stress at the free surface or an astronomical tidal potential, and the damping could be due to the turbulent stress of a bottom boundary layer. Regardless of the details, the forced response is composed of shallow-water waves, possibly including Kelvin waves, with the largest amplitudes in waves with a natural frequency ωf close to that of the forcing frequency ω; various examples of this sort are given in Chapters 9 and 10 of Gill [16]. When ω≈ωf, there is a large amplitude near-resonant response, the size of which is sensitive to the weak damping and |ω−ωf|. Thus, in numerical solutions of near-resonantly forced waves, we anticipate that errors in ωf (associated with the spatial discretisation) could lead to non-trivial errors in the forced response.

In the literature, curved pathways along the <100> direction passing through the 48i site are generally observed in fluorite materials [20], the prevalence of curve pathway as opposed from straight pathway is explained by the repulsion between cation and anions, the curved pathway allowing the cation–anion to maintain a reasonable distance.

82,82,"Within a coalescence approach as successfully applied earlier in the light-quark sector, we have evaluated transverse-momentum dependencies of charmed hadrons in central heavy-ion reactions at RHIC. For the charm-quark distributions at hadronization we have considered two limiting scenarios, i.e., no reinteractions (using spectra from PYTHIA) and complete thermalization with transverse flow of the bulk matter. The resulting J/ψ (mT-)spectra differ in slope by up to a factor of 2 (harder for pQCD c-quarks), and the integrated yield is about a factor of 3 larger in the thermal case. For D-mesons, we found that the difference in the slope parameters of the pT-spectra in the two scenarios is less pronounced, but their elliptic flow is about a factor of 2 larger for pT⩾1.5 GeV in the thermalized case. The elliptic flow pattern of D-mesons was found to be essentially preserved in the single-electron decay spectra, rendering the latter a very promising observable to address the strength of charm reinteractions in the QGP. The present study can be straightforwardly generalized to charmed baryons (Λc), which may serve as a complimentary probe for charm-quark reinteractions in the QGP.

They tested the ARS(2,3,2) scheme of Ascher et al. [1] and also suggested the less computationally expensive but nearly as accurate Strang carryover scheme. This involves Strang splitting but the first implicit stage is cleverly re-used from the final implicit stage of the previous time-step and so there is only one implicit solution per time-step. Another novel approach taken by Ullrich and Jablonowski [23] is to use a Rosenbrock solution in order to treat all of the vertical terms implicitly rather than just the terms involved in wave propagation. A Rosenbrock solution is one iteration of a Newton solver. This circumvents the time-step restriction associated with vertical advection at the cost of slowing the vertical advection.

Central scission is observed for polystyrene in a number of good solvents under certain jetting conditions for a bounded range of molecular weights.

87,87,"Water is the most important liquid, and the nature of its structure remains a topic of keen debate and an active area of research [1–9]. Much of this debate centers around whether water has a mainly tetrahedral structure with a continuum of distorted hydrogen bonds, or if it contains a mixture of two distinct components. One major development in recent years is the application of inner-shell spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) at the oxygen K-edge to investigate the structure of water [2,10–12]. These methods can provide a direct structural probe of water, providing insight into the nature of its hydrogen bonding network. Theoretical studies play a critical role in these studies, since the analysis of the experimental data requires calculations to provide a link between the observed spectral features and the underlying structure. However, the simulation of the XAS or XES for liquid water presents a difficult challenge because it requires accurate molecular dynamics simulations to provide a correct description of the molecular structure coupled with accurate calculations of the spectral properties, i.e. excitation energies and line intensities. Furthermore, adequate sampling over molecular configurations also needs to be accounted for.

The impact of shading on performance varies depending on the electrical series and parallel arrangement of cells within a module and modules within an installed array. Whilst many approaches to shading analysis have been proposed, computational efficiency is not reported despite being of high importance when incorporating shading algorithms into an overall energy yield model. The lack of consideration of the non-linear impacts of shading on smaller systems for example means that the shading loss is significantly underestimated, especially from supposedly small obstacles such as antennas or chimneys. As an example, the system shown in Fig. 1 illustrates the case where the installer may have attested a shade loss factor close to unity under UK microgeneration guidelines (Microgeneration Certification Scheme, 2013), i.e. negligible, but the performance of the system is severely compromised due to the non-linear cell mismatch effects.

First, we shall present a concise analysis of the lepton mass matrices in Table 1 and reveal their isomeric features, namely, they have the same phenomenological consequences, although their structures are apparently different. Second, we shall examine the predictions of these lepton mass matrices by comparing them with the 2σ and 3σ intervals of two neutrino mass-squared differences and three lepton flavor mixing angles,22To be specific, we make use of the 2σ and 3σ intervals of two neutrino mass-squared differences and three lepton flavor mixing angles given by M. Maltoni et al. in Ref. [5]. which are obtained from a global analysis of the latest solar, atmospheric, reactor (KamLAND and CHOOZ [10]) and accelerator (K2K) neutrino data. We find no parameter space allowed for six isomeric lepton mass matrices at the 2σ level. At the 3σ level, however, their results for neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing angles can be compatible with current data. Third, we incorporate the seesaw mechanism and the Fukugita–Tanimoto–Yanagida hypothesis [9] in the charged lepton and Dirac neutrino mass matrices with six texture zeros. It turns out that their predictions, including θ23≈45°, are in good agreement with the present experimental data even at the 2σ level.

91,91,"Ultrasound (US) can initiate the release of drugs from liposomes via an event called inertial cavitation, whereby the rarefactional phase of an ultrasound wave causes the expansion of a gas bubble followed by a violent collapse due to the inertia of the surrounding media. This collapse creates shock waves which can disrupt the stability of co-localised liposomal drug carriers. To date, studies have concentrated on the use of low frequency or high intensity US to generate gas bubbles in situ, and most recently such parameters have been used to achieve a variable level of triggered drug release following an intratumoral injection of liposomes [14]. However, concerns persist over the damage to non-target tissue that such US exposure parameters may cause and whether ultimately they will be widely clinically applicable. An alternative strategy is to utilise high-frequency US pulses at pressures in the diagnostic range in the presence of pre-existing gas bubbles. This provides an inertial cavitation stimulus for drug release using safe, clinically achievable US exposure conditions and approved US contrast agents [15]. Indeed, in the context of improving the delivery of therapeutics such as oncolytic viruses, this approach has already shown great promise [16]. A further advantage of this approach is that US-induced cavitation events produce distinct acoustic emissions that can be recorded and characterised providing non-invasive feedback, a feature which has proven useful in ablative US applications [17–19].

92,92,"Designers of microfluidic devices are in need of computational tools that can be used to analyse problems that involve rarefied gas flows in complex micro geometries. Numerical simulation of the gas flow through such geometries is, however, extremely challenging. Conventional continuum fluid dynamics (CFD) becomes invalid or inaccurate as the characteristic scale of the geometry (e.g. the channel height, h) approaches the molecular mean free path, λ [1,2]. When λ/h≳0.1, the error in solutions obtained from CFD may be significant, and we must consider the fluid for what it is: a collection of interacting particles. However, the computational expense of simulating the flow of a rarefied gas in high-aspect-ratio micro geometries (i.e. ones that are long, relative to their cross section) using a particle method, such as the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method [2], can be prohibitively high [3,4]. The computational intensity of the particle method is greater still when simulating low-speed microfluidic devices where there are only small deviations from equilibrium, characterised by extremely low Mach numbers and weak temperature gradients.

94,94,"We have developed the theory of electrons carrying quantized orbital angular momentum. To make connection to realistic situations, we considered a plane wave moving along the optic axis of a lens system, intercepted by a round, centered aperture.88In the experiment, this aperture carries the holographic mask. It turns out that the movement along the optic axis can be separated off; the reduced Schrödinger equation operating in the plane of the aperture can be mapped onto Bessel's differential equation. The ensuing eigenfunctions fall into families with discrete orbital angular momentum ℏm along the optic axis where m is a magnetic quantum number. Those vortices can be produced by matching a plane wave after passage through a holographic mask with a fork dislocation to the eigenfunctions of the cylindrical problem. Vortices can be focussed by magnetic lenses into volcano-like charge distributions with very narrow angular divergence, resembling loop currents in the diffraction plane. Inclusion of spherical aberration changes the ringlike shape but does not destroy the central zero intensity of vortices with m≠0. Partial coherence of the incident wave leads to a rise of the central intensity minimum. It is shown that a very small source angle (i.e. a very high coherence) is necessary so as to keep the volcano structure intact. Their small angular width in the far field may allow the creation of nm-sized or smaller electron vortices but the demand for extremely high coherence of the source poses a serious difficulty.

95,95,"Longitudinal beam and target single-spin asymmetries have been at the center of the attention lately, since they have been measured by the HERMES and CLAS experimental Collaborations [1–4] and more measurements are planned. They were originally believed to be signals of the so-called T-odd fragmentation functions [5], in particular, of the Collins function [6–12]. However, both types of asymmetry can receive contributions also from T-odd distribution functions [13–16], a fact that has often been neglected in analyses. An exhaustive treatment of the contributions of T-odd distribution functions has not been carried out completely so far, especially up to subleading order in an expansion in 1/Q, Q2 being the virtuality of the incident photon and the only hard scale of the process, and including quark mass corrections. It is the purpose of the present work to describe the longitudinal beam and target spin asymmetries in a complete way in terms of leading and subleading twist distribution and fragmentation functions. We consider both single-particle inclusive DIS, e+p→e′+h+X, and single-jet inclusive DIS, e+p→e′+jet+X. We assume factorization holds for these processes, even though at present there is no factorization proof for observables containing subleading-twist transverse-momentum dependent functions (only recently proofs for the leading-twist case have been presented in Refs. [17,18]).

96,96,"The crack band approach for producing mesh independent load–displacement curves for fracture in plain concrete is based on the idea that the crack opening is transformed into inelastic strain by distributing it over an element length dependent zone [5]. This approach will only produce mesh independent load–displacement curves, if the inelastic strain profiles in the finite element analysis are mesh size dependent. This requirement is an important difference to the nonlocal model which is designed to produce both mesh size independent load–displacement curves and strain profiles. In CDPM2, the crack band approach is applied only to the tensile part of the damage algorithm by replacing the stress–inelastic strain law shown in Fig. 2(b) by a stress–inelastic displacement law of the form(13)σ=ftexp(−ϵinhwft)if(ϵin>0)Here, wft is a crack opening threshold used to control the slope of the softening curve and h is the width of the crack-band, which in the present study is equal to the maximum dimension of the element along the principal direction of the strain tensor corresponding to the maximum tensile principal strain at the onset of damage. For the compressive part, a stress–inelastic strain law was used to determine the compressive damage parameter, since it was reported in [14] for columns subjected to eccentric compression that inelastic strain profiles in compression do not exhibit a mesh dependence which would satisfy the assumptions of the crack-band approach. This approach of applying the crack-band approach only to the tensile part has already been successfully used in Grassl et al. [16].

Nanofeature stamps were then created from the samples using conventional electron beam lithography (EBL) with negative tone electron sensitive resist, hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ). An Al discharge layer was required above the resist to prevent e-beam deflection due to charge build-up on the surface [17]. Several stamps were produced with this process and the pattern written varied in design but consisted of arrays of circular pillars. After EBL and HSQ development, the HSQ was used as an etch mask for RIE with a mixture of oxygen and argon gas. The etched diamond nanopillars were typically 225nm high.

Significance was assessed using a 1-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test since the error distributions were generally not symmetric. The estimation errors for AAMM and its non-adaptive counterpart, AAMM (no adapt.), were similar in the beginning of the application phase, but as anticipated, as the application phase went on, the AAMM technique continually improved its accuracy by incorporating more and more data into the model. On average the motion estimation of AAMM improved by 22.94% in T5 with respect to its non-adaptive counterpart. However, the method has already significantly adapted to the breathing pattern in T2, i.e. after between 3 and 7 min of imaging, where motion estimations where on average 16.87% more accurate than at the beginning of the adaptation phase. By visually inspecting the curves for AAMM in Fig. 8 it can be seen that for many volunteers (in particular volunteers A, D, E, and F) the error curves start to flatten approximately around the 7 min mark. From this it can be concluded that a longer calibration scan of around 12 min would be optimal, that is the 5 min that were used for calibration in this experiment plus 7 min worth of data added during the application phase.

Local field effects on spontaneous emission rates within nanostructured photonic materials for example are familiar, and have been well summarized [1]. Optical processes, including resonance energy transfer are similarly dependent on the local environment of molecular chromophores [2–4]. Many biological systems are known to contain complex organizations of molecules with absorption bands shifted due to the electronic influence of other, nearby optical centres. For instance, in widely studied light-harvesting complexes, there are two identifiable forms of the photosynthetic antenna molecule bacteriochlorophyll, with absorption bands centred on 800 and 850nm; it has been shown that the most efficient forms of energy transfer between the two occurs when there is a neighbouring carotenoid species 5–7. Until now, research on the broader influence of a neighbouring, off-resonant, molecule on photon absorption has mostly centred on the phenomenon of induced circular dichroism, where both quantum electrodynamic (QED) calculations [8–10] and experimental procedures [11–13] predict and verify that a chiral mediator confers the capacity for an achiral acceptor to exhibit circular differential absorption.

105,105,"Production of charmonium states J/ψ and ψ′ in nucleus–nucleus collisions has been studied at CERN SPS over the previous 15 years by the NA38 and NA50 Collaborations. This experimental program was mainly motivated by the suggestion [1] to use the J/ψ as a probe of the state of matter created at the early stage of the collision. The original picture [1] (see also [2] for a modern review) assumes that charmonia are created exclusively at the initial stage of the reaction in primary nucleon–nucleon collisions. During the subsequent evolution of the system, the number of hidden charm mesons is reduced because of: (a) absorption of pre-resonance charmonium states by nuclear nucleons (normal nuclear suppression), (b) interactions of charmonia with secondary hadrons (comovers), (c) dissociation of cc̄ bound states in deconfined medium (anomalous suppression). It was found [3] that J/ψ suppression with respect to Drell–Yan muon pairs measured in proton–nucleus and nucleus–nucleus collisions with light projectiles can be explained by the so-called “normal” (due to sweeping nucleons) nuclear suppression alone. In contrast, the NA50 experiment with a heavy projectile and target (Pb+Pb) revealed essentially stronger J/ψ suppression for central collisions [4–7]. This anomalous J/ψ suppression was attributed to formation of quark–gluon plasma (QGP) [7], but a comover scenario cannot be excluded [8].

Later, ternary chalcogenide (BixSb1−x)2Te3 [4,5], which has similar tetradymite structure to the parent compounds Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3, was predicted by ab initio calculations and confirmed by ARPES measurements as a tunable topological insulator whose Fermi energy and carrier density can be adjusted via changing the Bi/Sb composition ratio with stable topological surface state for the entire composition range. Combined with magnetism or superconductivity, TIs have attracted great attention due to the rich variety of new physics and applications. The ferromagnetism in several transition metal (TM) doped TIs, which breaks the time-reversal symmetry, has been reported [6–13]. Ferromagnetism in TIs is important because the combination of magnetism with TIs makes a good platform to study fundamental physical phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect [14–17], Majorana fermions [18], image magnetic monopole effect [19], and topological contributions to the Faraday and Kerr magneto-optical effect [20].

108,108,"Let us now consider the case of a beta-beam source. Similarly to the case of a static tritium source, an advantage of the beta-beams is that the neutrino fluxes can be very accurately calculated. Fig. 3 shows the electron–neutrino scattering events in the range of 0.1 MeV to 1 MeV and 1 keV to 10 keV, respectively. (In Fig. 3(b) we have rounded to the nearest integer number of counts.) The shape of the flux-averaged cross sections is very similar to the reactor case as reflected in the event rates shown in the figures. As can be seen, by measuring electron recoils in the keV range with a beta-beam source one could, with a sufficiently strong source, have a very clear signature for a neutrino magnetic moment of 5×10−11μB. These figures are for Helium-6 ions, however, similar results can be obtained using neutrinos from 18Ne. The results shown are obtained for an intensity of 1015 ν/s (i.e., 1015  ions/s). If there is no magnetic moment, this intensity will produce about 170 events in the 0.1 MeV to 1 MeV range per year and 3 events in the 1 keV to 10 keV range per year. These numbers increase to 210 and 55, respectively, in the case of a magnetic moment of 5×10−11μB.

111,111,"Typical physically-based 2D flood models solve the Shallow Water Equations (SWEs), requiring high computational resources. Many of these models have been developed to obtain better performance, while maintaining the required accuracy, by reducing the complexity of the SWEs. This reduction is usually achieved by approximating or neglecting less significant terms of the equations (Hunter et al., 2007; Yen and Tsai, 2001). The JFLOW model (Bradbrook et al., 2004), Urban Inundation Model (UIM) (Chen et al., 2007), and the diffusive version of LISFLOOD-FP (Hunter et al., 2005) solve the 2D diffusion wave equations that neglect the inertial (local acceleration) and advection (convective acceleration) terms (Yen and Tsai, 2001). The inertial version of LISFLOOD-FP (Bates et al., 2010) solves the SWEs without the advection term. In either version of LISFLOOD-FP the flow is decoupled in the Cartesian directions. Other models use the full SWEs but focus on the use of multi resolution grids or irregular mesh, like InfoWorks ICM (Innovyze, 2012) and MIKE FLOOD (DHI Software, 2014; Hénonin et al., 2013). These last two models are commercial packages, and the code applied in the optimisation techniques is not in the public domain.

112,112,"Based on the theoretical analysis, the value of the measuring resistor, Rm, has no effect on the corrosion process and on the estimated value of noise resistance. In order to validate this conclusion, the experiment of Fig. 9 was performed. Specifically, a pair of nominally identical specimens was initially coupled by a 4.7kΩ resistor and their potential with respect to a saturated calomel electrode was recorded by using a NI-USB 6009 analog-to-digital converter. The electrochemical noise signal was recorded using in-house developed software, acquiring at 1023Hz segments of 1000 points at each iteration. Between iterations, the 1000 values acquired were averaged to obtain a single value of potential, subsequently saved to the file used for later processing. The final dataset comprised potential values spaced 1±0.05s in time. Under the assumption that the noise present above 1023Hz is negligible compared with the noise present below 0.5Hz, this procedure enables an accurate recording of the potential noise in the frequencies of interest, avoiding aliasing of frequencies between 0.5 and 1023Hz and minimizing the 50Hz interference from the mains supply.

Fig. 17 shows the temperature profile during the recycling of the CPA pill and subsequent operation at 200mK. During the hold time, the servo control program maintained the CPA pill temperature to within a millikelvin. It is expected that microkelvin stability can be achieved with fast read-out thermometry (which was not available at the time of testing but which will be used for the mKCC), as this would allow for temperature control on much faster (millisecond) timescales than the current (approximately 1s) thermometry readout used.

114,114,"A fluctuating vacuum is a general feature of quantum fields, of which the free Maxwell field considered in  [1–12] is but one example. Fermionic fields such as that describing the electron, also undergo vacuum fluctuations, consequently one expects to find Casimir effects associated with such fields whenever they are confined in some way. Such effects were first investigated in the context of nuclear physics, within the so-called “MIT bag model” of the nucleon  [13]. In the bag-model one envisages the nucleon as a collection of fermionic fields describing confined quarks. These quarks are subject to a boundary condition at the surface of the ‘bag’ that represents the nucleon’s surface. Just as in the electromagnetic case, the bag boundary condition modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the field, which results in the appearance of a Casimir force  [14–18]. This force, although very weak at a macroscopic scale, can be significant on the small length scales encountered in nuclear physics. It therefore has important consequences for the physics of the bag-model nucleon  [19].

115,115,"Note that the quantitative introduction of a reactive functionality into the polymer chain end can be easily achieved by adopting the living ROMP technique especially using the Schrock type molybdenum alkylidene initiator [7,12,21,61–65]. The exclusive preparation of end-functionalized ring-opened polymers (realized by a living polymerization with quantitative initiation) can be applied not only to prepare block copolymers (ABCs) coupled with another living polymerization techniques [66], but also for preparation of macromonomers, as described below. In contrast, the initiation efficiency is not always perfect as seen in the molybdenum alkylidene initiators, because dissociation of ligand (PR3 etc.) should be required to generate the catalytically active species in the ROMP with the ruthenium carbene catalysts (Scheme 2) [67–69]. An equilibrium between coordination and dissociation of PR3 should be present even in the propagation process, and replacement of halogen with the other anionic ligand (and/or replacement of PR3 with the other neutral donor ligands/substrates) can also be considered as the probable side reactions. Importance of using the molybdenum catalysts should be thus emphasized for their precise preparations, although the initiators are highly sensitive to moisture and both monomers and solvent have to be thus strictly purified to avoid the catalyst decomposition (deactivation).

In the parametric approach, a nonlinear parametric model is first identified from the input–output data. The GFRFs are then obtained by mapping the resultant model into the frequency domain using the probing method [9]. The nonparametric approach is often referred to as frequency-domain Volterra system identification and is based on the observation that the Volterra model of nonlinear systems is linear in terms of the unknown Volterra kernels, which, in the frequency domain, corresponds to a linear relation between the output frequency response and linear, quadratic, and higher order GFRFs. This linear relationship allows the use of a least squares (LS) approach to solve for the GFRFs. Several researchers [10–12] have used this method to estimate the GFRFs. But they usually made the assumption that it is known a priori that the system under study can be represented by just two or three terms. However, such information is rarely available a priori.

119,119,"From a general point of view, polymerization techniques can be divided into two types of chemical reactions: step-growth polymerization and free radical polymerization. Step-growth polymerization is widely used for synthesis of polyesters, polyamide and epoxies while the synthesis of polyacrylics requires the use of free radical polymerization. These polymerization reactions can be performed either in bulk or in solution or in dispersed media. Heterophase polymerizations (i.e. emulsion, dispersion and miniemulsion polymerizations) present the advantage of easier removal of the resulting product from the reactor compared to bulk polymerization thanks to the low viscosity of the reaction medium. Polymerization in solution also induces lower viscosity but also lower reaction rates due to dilution of the reactants and higher cost and environmental impact due to the use of organic solvents. These problems are solved in the case of heterophase polymerizations where the reactants are confined inside droplets (no dilution effect) and water is used as medium. The use of surfactant molecules are usually needed for the stabilization of the monomer droplet and subsequent polymer particles in the water phase.

124,124,"Social network gaming, which refers to playing games that are connected to social networking services (SNS) directly, or through mobile applications (apps), is a popular online activity. Social network games (SNG) are generally free-to-play and do not award monetary prizes, but users can make in-game purchases to advance within the game, customise the game, give gifts to friends, and access other exclusive benefits and features, leading to these games being referred to as ‘freemium’. Although SNG are connected to a SNS and encourage users to interact with their connections, most SNG can be played without any social interaction. SNG have grown rapidly in popularity and the global SNG market is predicted to grow annually at 16% from 2013 to 2019 to reach a total market value of US$17.4 billion (Transparency Market Research, 2015). A survey of Facebook users in Australia in November 2012 reported that there are over 3.5 million social gamers across Australia and almost 70% play SNG daily (Spiral Media, 2013), and it is highly likely that the use of SNG has increased since this time.

The Otsu scheme, a widely used image thresholding technique, provides approving results for segmenting a gray level image with only one modal distribution in gray level histogram. However, it provides poor results if the histogram of a gray level is non-bimodal. For enhancing the performance of the Otsu algorithm further, in this work, an improved median-based Otsu image thresholding algorithm is presented.

A pioneering theoretical paper of Martin and Davidson published in 1978 showed that the obtuse isosceles geometry is lower in energy than the linear conformation [6]. Several extended PES scans of Na3 and other alkali trimers followed this initial study, employing DFT [7], complete active space SCF [8], or a configuration interaction approach based on valence bond wave functions [9]. Recently, the applicability of density functional theory (DFT) to JT-distorted systems has also been tested for Na3 [10], and the B-X transition has been revisited as well, applying state-averaged multi-reference configuration interaction with a large active space in order to derive more accurate non-adiabatic coupling terms for an improved interpretation of photoabsorption spectra [11–13].

127,127,"MINERAL (MINeral ERror AnaLysis) is a new MATLAB® based program that provides mineral formula recalculations combined with the associated propagation of the analytical uncertainties. Methods are based on the work of Giamarita and Day (1990). However, additional features have been added to provide users with greater flexibility in data reporting. Many programs exist to recalculate wt% data into formula unit cations. Some generalized programs can be used to recalculate the formula of multiple minerals e.g. CALCMIN (Brandelik, 2009) and HYPER-FORM (De Bjerg et al., 1992). Other programs are mineral specific e.g. AMPH CLASS (Esawi, 2004) and PROBE AMPH (Tindle and Webb, 1994) for the recalculation of amphibole analyses; ILMAT (Lepage, 2003) for the recalculation of magnetite and ilmenite; and PX-NOM (Sturm, 2002) for the recalculation of pyroxene analyses. MINERAL provides a rapid method for the recalculation of multiple common minerals. However, its strength lies in the fact that is the first tool to incorporate the associated uncertainty propagation calculations. As these are performed concurrently with the standard recalculations, no additional time is needed to perform uncertainty propagation. While an understanding of the underlying calculations is strongly recommended, MINERAL is designed to allow users with little or no experience operating MATLAB® and/or performing mineral formula recalculations and uncertainty propagation to undertake both with ease.

129,129,"Hitherto, the investigation of fossil-orientation was only used for the topmost surface of fossil mass occurrences, deposited directly on the sea floor. Due to the fast development of virtual methods (e.g., macro-CT, µ-CT, nano-CT, etc.) it became possible, to investigate the interior orientation of such fossil mass occurrences in three-dimensional detail. Although, a series of paleontological studies deal with 3D-visualization of fossil-elements, no mass occurrence has previously been reconstructed three dimensionally for investigating their interior orientation. This study illustrates an interdisciplinary approach of virtual reconstruction, analyses and interpretation of the interior orientation of an ammonoid mass occurrence. The method established herein produces clear and consistent results using planispirally coiled ammonoid shells – fossils, that so far would have been used only with caution for depositional interpretations. This method can be applied to any kind of fossil mass occurrence, or even other abundant organic elements and particles, to examine their orientation and depositional conditions to conclude on their paleoenvironment, particularly on paleocurrents.

130,130,"Experimental studies of the dynamics of individual carbon atoms in graphene have been empowered by the recent progress in aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-TEM) capable of sub-Ångstrom resolution. The examples include AC-TEM observations of the formation and annealing of Stone–Wales defects [1], edge reconstruction [2,3] and formation of a large hole in graphene sheet from a single vacancy defect [3]. The AC-TEM has been also exploited in visualization in real time of the process of self-assembly of graphene nanoribbons from molecular precursors [4,5] and formation of nanometre size hollow protrusion on the nanotube sidewall [6]. Based on AC-TEM observations of transformation of small finite graphene flake into fullerene, a new ‘top-down’ mechanism for the formation of fullerene under the electron beam radiation has been proposed [7]. The critical step in the proposed ‘top-down’ mechanism of the fullerene formation is creation of vacancies in small graphene flake as a result of knock-on damage by electrons of the imaging electron beam (e-beam). The subsequent formation of pentagons at the vacancy sites near the edge reduces the number of dangling bonds and triggers the curving process of graphene flake into a closed fullerene structure [7]. Thus, dynamic behaviour of vacancies near graphene edge plays a crucial role in explaining mechanisms of the e-beam assisted self-assembly and structural transformations in graphene-like structures.

131,131,"Ferritic and martensitic steels are candidate materials for use in nuclear reactors [1,2]. The transmutation-created inert gas, especially He, plays an important role in the microstructural evolution of these steels under neutron irradiation. In a previous paper [3] the mechanisms by which He in a perfect body-centred-cubic (bcc) Fe lattice, can agglomerate into bubbles was discussed. It was shown that small He interstitial clusters are highly mobile but become effectively pinned with the emission of Fe interstitials when the clusters contain 5 or more He atoms. Small bubbles up to around 1.5 nm in diameter can easily form at room temperature from such seed points but larger bubbles are more difficult to form by diffusion alone due to the induced strain in the bcc lattice which increases the energy barriers for diffusion towards the bubbles whilst reducing them in a direction away from the bubbles. Subsequent bubble enlargement can then only occur either through increased temperature or by radiation induced mechanisms which increase the number of vacancies in the bubble and reduce the lattice strain. Emission of interracial loops from such a bubble was not observed in molecular dynamics simulations.

Rectangular noble metal thin film current collectors were deposited on top and beneath the MIEC layer and used for polarization. The lateral distribution of the tracer revealed several interesting features: (i) In case of thermal tracer exchange, an enhanced tracer fraction is found on top of the metallic current collector due to its ionically blocking nature. At the edges of the current collector, the concentration of 18O decreases with a finite step width that is correlated with in-plane diffusion of oxygen ions. (ii) Due to the low electronic conductivity of STFO and GDC, the MIEC area that is influenced by an applied bias is restricted to a region close to the current collector. The width of this active region depends on the bias. It amounts to only 10–15μm for STFO but more than 100μm for GDC at a cathodic bias of −500mV. (iii) Not only enhanced tracer incorporation due to cathodic bias but also reduced incorporation due to anodic bias could be experimentally resolved in the active region.

134,134,"Despite the ubiquity of time-dependent dynamical systems in nature, there has been relatively little work done on the analysis of time series from such systems. Mathematically they are known as non-autonomous systems, which are named as such because, unlike autonomous systems, in addition to the points in space over which they are observed they are also influenced by the points in time. Recently there has been much work on the direct ‘bottom-up’ approach to these systems, which includes the introduction of a subclass known as chronotaxic systems that are able to model the stable but time-varying frequencies of oscillations in living systems  [8,9]. In contrast, the time series analysis of these systems, referred to as the inverse or ‘top-down’ approach, has not been studied in detail before. This is partly because non-autonomous systems can still be analysed in the same way as other types of systems in both the deterministic  [10] and the stochastic  [11] regime. However, it is now argued that this type of analysis is insufficient and that an entirely new analytical framework is required to provide a more useful picture of such systems. In the case of chronotaxic systems some methods have already been developed for the inverse approach and they have shown to be useful in analysing heart rate variability  [12]. A general and dedicated procedure for analysing non-autonomous systems has still not been tackled though.

138,138,"The observed conductivity of A2FeMoO6–δ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) [7] was linked to a potential double exchange mechanism, with conduction between Fe3+-O-Mo-O-Fe2+. Double-exchange mechanisms, as proposed by Zener [23], posit that electron transfer between ions in different oxidation states may be facilitated if the electron does not have to alter its spin state. Replacement of Mo with Fe in this mechanism would be expected to result in a reduction of the conductivity through reduction of the available percolation pathways, unless delocalisation of Fe electrons through Fe2+-O-Fe3+ exchange could also occur. Double exchange mechanisms have been observed previously for mixed valent iron in iron oxides [24], and, as iron is known to exist in a mixed valent state for Ca2–xSrxFeMoO6–δ [25], this provides a plausible explanation for the observed metallic conductivity.

Three main causes for failure were identified, namely, fatigue, corrosion and the presence of manufacturing defects. Human factor induced defects proved to have little impact – less than 10% of the cases could be attributed to operation errors. Fatigue was found being induced by several factors: excessive vibration, pressure shocks and the thermal regime of operating the pipe, as well as by combinations of these factors. Corrosion was induced, in most of the cases, by a non-appropriate choice of alloys while not taking into account the chemical parameters of the fluid inside pipes.

141,141,"While impedance spectroscopy is a quite common method to investigate mixed conducting thin film electrodes, [6,10–12] oxygen tracer experiments are often performed on bulk samples [13–16]. Recently, several IEDP measurements of mixed conducting cathode materials were published with the oxide films being deposited on insulating substrates [17–19]. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge no study so far reported experiments with both techniques being applied on the same films at the same temperature. This contribution reports the results of a study applying EIS and IEDP to one and the same La0.6Sr0.4CoO3−δ (LSC) thin film in order to get complementary results on the resistive contributions of the oxygen reduction kinetics on such films. As electrical measurements require an oxygen ion conductor, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was used as substrate for LSC films with two different grain sizes. Quantitative material parameters are deduced from both types of experiments and comparison of the data allowed testing the appropriateness of analysis models.

142,142,"This paper has highlighted a band of frequencies, outside the conventional operation range, and close to electrical resonance of an eddy current probe, where the magnitude of impedance SNR reaches a peak. The SNR of scans of three slots of varying depth were enhanced by a factor of up to 3.7, from the SNR measured at 1MHz. This is a result of a defect-decoupling resonance-shift effect and is referred to as the near electrical resonance signal enhancement (NERSE) phenomenon. NERSE frequency operation has significant potential for ECT inspection, and opens up a range of investigative possibilities. Within this investigation, only the magnitude of the electrical impedance has been analyzed. An immediate extension of this investigation will be to consider phase information, and determine whether a similar exploitable NERSE effect exists.

143,143,"Recently together with structural efficiency, passenger safety is also an important issue in application of material to transportation industries. Hence, the crashworthiness parameters are introducing to predict the capability of structure to prevent the massive damage and protect the passenger in the event of a crash. Crashworthiness parameters for various thin-walled tubes made from metal or fibre/resin composites in different geometries have been studied. A critical difference of tubular composites failure modes compared with metallic is the brittle collapse. In addition, in composites, tubular failure modes are involved with micro-cracking development, delamination, fibre breakage, etc., instead of plastic deformation. Implementation of composite materials in the field of crashworthiness is attributed to Hull, who in 80s and 90s of the last century studied extensively the crushing behaviour of fibre reinforced composite material. He found that the composite materials absorbed high energy in the face of the fracture surface energy mechanism rather than plastic deformation as observed for metals [1]. This observation has inspired others to further investigation about crashworthiness characteristics of composite materials. Studies have examined the axial crushing behaviour of fibre-reinforced tubes [2], fibreglass tubes [3,4], PVC tubes [5] and carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) tubes [6].

144,144,"In the bag model and in linear or harmonic oscillator confining potentials, the first excited S-state lies above the lowest P-state, making the predicted Roper mass heavier than the lightest negative parity baryon mass. Pairwise spin-dependent interactions must reverse the level ordering. As mentioned earlier, color-spin interactions fail in this regard [29], while flavor-spin interactions produce the desired effect. Since the q3 color wave function is antisymmetric, the flavor-spin-orbital wave function is totally symmetric. For all quarks in an S-state, the flavor-spin wave function is totally symmetric all by itself and leads to the most attractive flavor-spin interaction. If one quark is in a P-state, the orbital wave function is mixed symmetry and so is the flavor-spin wave function, and the flavor-spin interaction is a less attractive. In the SU(3)F symmetric case, Eq. (1), one obtains mass splittings (2)ΔMχ=−14Cχ,N(939),N∗(1440),−4Cχ,Δ(1232),−2Cχ,N∗(1535).

There is some uncertainty in predicting e−(e+) event rates for these processes which arise due to the nuclear model dependencies of the absorption cross section and the treatment of the Coulomb distortion of electron (positron) in the field of the residual nucleus. The nuclear absorption cross section for the charged current neutrino reactions in 40Ar relevant to supernova neutrino energies was first calculated by Raghavan [10] and Bahcall et al. [11] for Fermi transitions leading to isobaric analogue state (IAS) at 4.38 MeV in 40K∗. Later Ormand et al. [12] used a shell model to calculate the Fermi and Gamow–Teller transitions. In these calculations Fermi function F(Z,Ee) was used to take into account the Coulomb effects. In a recent paper Bueno et al. [13] make use of a calculation by Martinez-Pinedo et al. [14] who use a shell model for Fermi and Gamow–Teller transitions and a continuum random phase approximation (CRPA) for forbidden transitions to calculate the absorption cross sections. In this calculation the Coulomb distortion of the produced electron is treated with a hybrid model where a Fermi function is used for lower electron energies and modified effective momentum approximation (MEMA) for higher electron energies [14–17].

These monitor sets consist of different metal wire pieces that have an activation reaction at a specific energy range. The different activation energies are chosen in such a way that the spectrum can be reconstructed. In BODEX, each capsule contained a flux monitor set on the ‘back side’ (as seen from the core) and one on the front side, positioned at the central height of the capsules. Additionally, one detector was placed at the top and one at the bottom, resulting in a total of 6 monitor sets per leg. The fluence in each capsule was determined as the average between the two flux monitor located in each capsule. The sets have been analysed by determining the activation of each wire piece, which indicates the fluence of a specific energy range.

147,147,"In this article we consider an extension to the equations of poroelasticity by modelling the flow of a slightly compressible single phase fluid in a viscoelastic porous medium. The constitutive equations therefore allow for the presence of viscoelastic relaxation effects in the porous media (but not the fluid). Fully discrete numerical schemes are derived based on a lagged and non-lagged backward Euler time stepping method applied to a mixed and Galerkin finite element spatial discretization. We show that the lagged scheme is unconditionally stable and give an optimal a priori error bound for it. Furthermore, this scheme is practical and useful in the sense that it can be easily implemented in existing poroelasticity software because the coupling between the viscous stresses and pressures and the elasticity and flow equations is ‘lagged’ by one time step. The required additional coding therefore takes the form of extra ‘right hand side loads’ together with some updating subroutines for the viscoelastic internal variables, but the solver and assembly engines remain intact. This idea of lagging has been used before for nonlinearly viscoelastic diffusion problems in [3,24] but, of course, is not new. Lagging in numerical schemes is discussed more widely by Lowrie in [14].

148,148,"The choice of the interpolation functions and support point coordinates for the gradient field is crucial to ensure stability and accuracy of the formulation. For example, nodal integration and NS-FEM are unstable involving the appearance of spurious low-energy modes. They need non-physical penalty energy functions that stabilize them. The articles [2,28] numerically verify the stability, convergence and accuracy of several W2 variants including new elements which can be constructed based on the idea of assumed continuous deformation gradients. For first order hexahedral elements, [2,28] found good results for the element types C3D_8N_27C and C3D_8N_8I. The first is defined by 27 support points and a second order tensor-product interpolation of the deformation gradient by Lagrange polynomials. The latter element type is defined by 16 support points with 8 points being coincident with the nodes and 8 additional points in the element interior. Among the tested first order tetrahedra, the nodally integrated tetrahedron with an additional bubble mode in the gradients was found to be most accurate. It turned out to be even the most efficient with respect to computing time in explicit analysis [28] because the enlarged critical time step compensates the slightly increased numerical cost per restoring force assembly.

However, Edeling et al.  [9] carried out separate calibrations for a set of 13 boundary-layer flows. They summarized this information across calibrations by computing Highest Posterior-Density (HPD) intervals, and subsequently represent the total solution uncertainty with a probability-box (p-box). This p-box represents both parameter variability across flows, and epistemic uncertainty within each calibration. A prediction of a new boundary-layer flow is made with uncertainty bars generated from this uncertainty information, and the resulting error estimate is shown to be consistent with measurement data. This approach is helpful, but it might be extended further by modelling proximity across flows through a distance that would relate to the flow characteristics in order to borrow strength across calibrations instead of splitting the calibrations and then merging the outcomes afterwards. This is a challenging but attractive venue for future research.

156,156,"Apache Pig is a platform for creating MapReduce workflows with Hadoop. These workflows are expressed as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks that exist at a conceptually higher level than their implementations as series of MapReduce jobs. Pig Latin is the procedural language used for building these workflows, providing syntax similar to the declarative SQL commonly used for relational database systems. In addition to standard SQL operations, Pig can be extended with user-defined functions (UDFs) commonly written in Java. We adopted Pig for our implementation of the correlator to speed up development time, allow for ad hoc workflow changes, and to embrace the Hadoop community׳s migration away from MapReduce towards more generalized DAG processing (Mayer, 2013). Specifically, in the event that future versions of Hadoop are optimized to support paradigms other than MapReduce, Pig scripts could take advantage of these advances without recoding, whereas explicit Java MapReduce jobs would need to be rewritten.

157,157,"Zirconium alloys are used as fuel cladding in pressurised and boiling water nuclear reactors. As such these materials are exposed to a large number of environmental factors that will promote degradation mechanisms such as oxidation. At high burn-ups, i.e. extended service life, oxidation and the associated hydrogen pick-up can be a limiting factor in terms of fuel efficiency and safety. The oxidation kinetics for many zirconium alloys are cyclical, demonstrating a series of approximately cubic kinetic curves separated by transitions [1–5]. These transitions are typified by a breakdown in the protective character of the oxide and are potentially linked to a number of mechanical issues. Understanding how these issues influence oxidation is a key to developing a full mechanistic understanding of the corrosion process.

158,158,"In this article we propose a method which adopts a different approach to the generation procedure outlined above and that helps to address the problem of generating high-order meshes for high Reynolds number flows. The method is conceptually simple, cheap to implement and does not require a dense linear boundary-layer mesh. It is based on the use of an isoparametric [17] or, in general, a transfinite interpolation [18] where a high-order coarse boundary-layer prismatic mesh is subdivided into either prisms or tetrahedra using the mapping that defines the coarse high-order prisms. The procedure is also very versatile as it permits meshes with different distributions of y+ to be generated with ease and furthermore, the validity of these meshes is guaranteed if the initial mesh is valid and the polynomial space is chosen appropriately.

Like nodal DG schemes, FR schemes utilise a high-order (nodal) polynomial basis to approximate the solution within each element of the computational domain, and like nodal DG schemes, FR schemes do not explicitly enforce inter-element solution continuity. However, unlike nodal DG schemes, FR methods are based solely on the governing system in a differential form. A description of the FR approach in 1D is presented below.

161,161,"AA 2024-T3 aluminium alloy is widely used for aerospace applications due to its high strength to weight ratio and high damage tolerance that result from copper and magnesium as the principal alloying elements and appropriate thermomechanical processing. The microstructure of the alloy is relatively complex and a number of compositionally-distinct phases have been identified [1]. Although possessing favourable mechanical properties, the alloy is relatively susceptible to corrosion and generally requires surface treatment in practical applications. The corrosion behaviour of the alloy is particularly affected by the presence of the intermetallic particles due to their differing potentials with respect to the alloy matrix [2–9]. Copper-containing second phase particles at the alloy surface are particularly detrimental to the corrosion resistance as they provide preferential cathodic sites [2,10]. One of the principle types of second phase particle that is important to the corrosion behaviour of the alloy is the S phase (Al2CuMg) particle [1,11]. Dealloying of S phase particles, which may account for ∼60% of the constituent particles in AA2024 alloys [11], is commonly observed when the alloy is exposed to an aggressive environment. The particles are considered as important initiation sites for severe localized corrosion in the alloy [11–22]. The dealloying of the S phase particles and the resulting enrichment of copper result in a decrease of the Volta potential with respect to the matrix and hence the dealloyed particles become active cathodic sites [23–25].

162,162,"This phase was completed in 2005. Previous contracts had been procured with the contractor providing the detailed design. For this system the design was undertaken by Mott MacDonald. It was developed by looking at the systems installed previously and calculating what was actually required to achieve cathodic protection of the piers. This resulted in a significant reduction in the number of zones and monitoring probes. The varying amounts of steelwork in the beams had previously lead to up to 5 zones per beam, with multiple layers of mesh to achieve the design current density. On review of the data the operating current density was similar in all zones and so this was reduced to a single zone per beam. The encapsulation was susceptible to ASR and contained post tensioning and so it was decided to use a galvanic system based on Galvashield CC anodes from Fosroc. Our design did not include an option to allow depolarization of the galvanic system, but the contractor supplied one, such that the anodes could be remotely disconnected. The control unit was from Electrotech CP and operated via a broadband connection provided by the contractor.

163,163,"The particular phase field model we employ is an extension of [6], and is based on the three dimensional thermal phase field model of [7] and two dimensional thermal-solutal phase field model of [8]. One feature of the physical problem is that it is purely dissipative, or entropy increasing, as all natural relaxational phenomena are. The resulting PDEs are of Allen–Cahn [9] and Carn–Hilliard type [10]. That is to say, the model involves time derivatives of the three fields coupled to forms involving variational derivatives of some functional – typically the free energy functional. As the dendrite grows the free energy reduces monotonically with time but never achieves equilibrium if the domain boundary is far from the dendrite. Although we have listed some of the difficult aspects of this model, the relaxational aspect is typically an asset and results in stable numerical schemes: there is no convection, for example (at least in the absence of flow in the melt).

The full Salpeter equation is a relativistic equation describing a bound state. Since this method has a very solid basis in quantum field theory, it is very good in describing a bound state which is a relativistic system. In a previous paper [16], we solved the instantaneous Bethe–Salpeter equation [17], which is also called full Salpeter equation [18]. After we solved the full Salpeter equation, we obtained the relativistic wave function of the bound state. We used this wave function to calculate the average kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside a heavy meson in 0− state, and obtained values which agree very well with recent experiments. We also found there that the relativistic corrections are quite large and cannot be ignored [16].

However, full-atomistic approaches to polymer crystallization need extremely large computer power even in the case of simple polymers, and appropriate modeling or coarse-graining of the system is imperative. From a series of work on the development of coarse-grained models for polymers, Mayer and Muller-Plathe have build up a model of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for studying early stage of crystallization. They investigated the emergence of crystalline order from the isotropic melt by rapid quenching [51,52]. They could reproduce many elementary processes of homogenous nucleation that showed good correspondence with experiments and other simulations, in temperature dependence of lamella thickness, structure of fold surface, etc. In their work, they neglected long-range force (van der Waals attraction) to accelerate computation. Their model has the energy contribution due to intrachain interactions only and the dominant driving force for crystallization is entropic, which seems to ignore dominant driving force for polymer crystallization in conventional sense. However, their work is reminiscent of the classical solid–liquid transition in systems of repulsive spherical atoms [53] and poses an intriguing problem as to the intrinsic driving force for polymer crystallization.

Misalignments between the ERP system specification and user needs led to the adoption of informal processes within the organisation. These processes are facilitated within an informal organisational structure and are based on human interactions undertaken within the formal organisation. Rather than to attempt to suppress the emergence of the informal organisation the company decided to channel the energies of staff involved in informal processes towards organisational goals. The company achieved this by harnessing the capabilities of what we term a hybrid ERP system, combining the functionality of a traditional (formal) ERP installation with the capabilities of Enterprise Social Software (ESS). However the company recognised that the successful operation of the hybrid ERP system would require a number of changes in organisational design in areas such as reporting structures and communication channels. A narrative provided by interviews with company personnel is thematised around the formal and informal characteristics of the organisation as defined in the literature.

169,169,"Certainly therefore the see-saw mechanism is an attractive explanation of why the light neutrino masses are so small. However, it is not without its faults. In particular, there is a tension between the strongly hierarchical nature of the observed Yukawa couplings in the quark and charged lepton sectors, and the essentially hierarchy-free masses implied by the Δm2's. Moreover, both the θ12 and θ23 mixing angles are large while the angle θ13 is small which is in sharp contrast with the corresponding mixings in the quark sector which are all small. These problems can be solved in specific models, for example, the Δm2 values can be fitted by taking the spectrum of rhd neutrino masses to be hierarchical in such a way as to almost compensate for the hierarchical neutrino Yukawa couplings. But this has the price of introducing a wide range of rhd neutrino masses MR∼1010–1015 which then require explanation.

Within these, it is worth highlighting the Principal Component Analysis method (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2002). In an N-dimensional vector space, the simplest version of PCA (linear PCA) is a technique that finds the mutually-uncorrelated vectors onto which the projection of the samples generates the highest variances. The result is a set of orthogonal vectors sorted in descending order of achieved variance. The first of these vectors is that onto which the variance of the projection of the samples is maximum. In this sense, the original KPIs constitute the N-dimensional vector space basis, whereas the N^ synthetic KPIs represent the orthogonal vectors with the highest variance. To be rigorous, up to N synthetic orthogonal KPIs may be computed. However, only a small set of them, the first N^, is enough to account for most of the variance of the data.

174,174,"The class of steels known as oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic alloys (also known as nanostructured ferritic alloys) consist of a dispersion of ultra-fine oxide particles throughout the matrix. These oxide particles serve to improve the mechanical properties of the system, particularly at high temperatures, of the system through inhibiting dislocation motion and grain boundary sliding. In nuclear applications the oxide particles have been suggested to act as point defect sinks [10,11] to improve radiation tolerance, and as preferential sites for the formation of nano-scale He bubbles therefore reducing swelling compared to non-ODS steels [12–15]. The ability of the oxide particles to improve these properties depends on the structure and composition of the particles [10,11,16,17] and their stability under irradiation. Typical compositions of ODS steels include between 9 and 14at.% Cr for oxidation resistance (most commonly 14at.%); W for solid solution hardening; Y2O3 that is put into solid solution during the initial, mechanical alloying, process but then during consolidation at high temperatures forms precipitates; and Ti to inhibit significant growth of the oxide particles; the balance being made up of Fe and impurities [18]. For this reason these steels are often referred to as 14YWT, reflecting the constituent elements.

175,175,"In this paper, however, we prefer the simpler ‘framed’ cell employed by Hadjiconstantinou and Patera [16], where the shear stress is generated by constraining the velocity in a ‘frame’ rather than by modifying the shape of the box. The framed cell is periodic, but we cannot simply calculate the average stress in the whole box because the presence of an external buffer would produce spurious results. We need the local stress in the core region, but this complicates the Oij term in Eq. (3). There are other methods to calculate the stress tensor such as the method of planes [32], the volume-average approach [26,14], or the method derived from the Schweitz virial relation [25], but, in general, we must choose between a complicated computational cell (i.e. Lees–Edwards cell) and simplifying the calculation of the momentum flux, or a simple cell (i.e. framed cell) and complicating the calculation of the momentum flux. The new method we propose here does not need the direct calculation of the flux, so it avoids this issue altogether: we can use the framed cell and, at the same time, avoid the calculation of the IK equation.

176,176,"We addressed the question whether carbohydrate coupling increased antigen uptake by DCs via C-type lectin receptor targeting. Therefore, the antigens were labeled with pHrodo Red dye (Invitrogen), a dye that specifically fluoresces as pH decreases from neutral to acidic, as provided in endosomes/lysosomes of cells. In vitro characterization of the cellular uptake of neoglycocomplexes using bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) demonstrated superior ingestion of mannan-conjugates MN–Ova and MN–Pap (Supplementary Fig. S4A-D,F). This was confirmed in vivo by intradermal needle-injection of labeled antigen into the ear pinnae of mice. Antigen uptake and transport to the ear dLNs were measured after 24h by FACS analysis. DCs in cervical LNs were identified according to their high expression of MHC class II (Fig. 3A) and additionally characterized by CD8α, CD11b, and CD11c expression and uptake of pHrodo-labeled antigen (Fig. 3B, D–F). The results showed significantly elevated numbers of pHrodo+MHCIIhigh DCs for mannan conjugates MN–Ova and MN–Pap (and to a lesser degree for MD–Pap) in comparison to the unmodified antigens (Fig. 3C). Both carbohydrates targeted antigen preferentially to CD8α− DCs, as indicated by an increase in CD8α−/pHrodo+ DCs compared to unmodified antigens (Fig. 3E and F). Nevertheless, whether the antigens were taken up in situ by dermal DCs or by LN resident APCs via the afferent lymphatics could not be fully elucidated. Histology revealed that antigen-loaded cells in the dLNs were already present 30min after intradermal injection (Supplementary Fig. S4G), suggesting both mechanisms.

177,177,"Note that the presented architecture works at the frame level, meaning that each single frame (plus its corresponding context) is fed-forward through the network, obtaining a class posterior probability for all of the target languages. This fact makes the DNNs particularly suitable for real-time applications because, unlike other approaches (i.e. i-vectors), we can potentially make a decision about the language at each new frame. Indeed, at each frame, we can combine the evidence from past frames to get a single similarity score between the test utterance and the targetlanguages. A simple way of doing this combination is to assume that frames are independent and multiply the posterior estimates of the last layer. The score sl for language l of a given test utterance is computed by multiplying the output probabilities pl obtained for all of its frames; or equivalently, accumulating the logs as:(6)sl=1N∑t=1Nlogp(Ll|xt​, θ)where p(Ll|xt​, θ) represents the class probability output for the language l corresponding to the input example at time t, xt by using the DNN defined by parameters θ.

178,178,"The related Volta potential (Ψ) is the potential difference between a position infinitely far away from the surface and a position just outside the surface, and is the measureable quantity characterising electrochemical behaviour of a metal [12,17]. The scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) technique allows detection of local EWF (if the EWF of the tip is known), or Volta potential differences (ΔΨ) between an atomic force microscopy tip (usually Pt coated) and the metal surface [14,15,19]. The lateral resolution of SKPFM can be as high as 10’s of nm in ambient air, with a sensitivity up to 10–20meV [19]. Volta potential is a characteristic property of a metal surface and can be used to understand electrochemical processes [16] . It is sensitive to any kind of surface defects, chemical variations, and residual stress [13,17]. Volta potential differences in microstructure have been used to predict corrosion behaviour [10,15,18,20–22]. Regions with larger (ΔΨ) indicate increased surface reactivity [11,15,18], and even a correlation between Volta potential differences measured in nominally dry air and their free corrosion potential (Ecorr) pre-determined under immersed conditions has been reported [18].

179,179,"After all micro elements reach a relaxed steady-state, measurements are obtained using a cumulative averaging technique to reduce noise. Each micro element is divided into spatially-oriented bins in the y-direction in order to resolve the velocity and shear-stress profiles. Velocity in each bin is measured using the Cumulative Averaging Method (CAM) [24], while the stress tensor field is measured using the Irving–Kirkwood relationship [25]. A least-squares polynomial fit to the data is performed, which helps reduce noise further. The fit produces a continuous function that avoids stability issues arising from supplying highly fluctuating data to the macro solver. A least-squares fit is applied to an Nth order polynomial for the velocity profile in the core region, and an Mth order polynomial for the velocity profile in the constrained region:(16)〈ui,core〉=∑k=1Nbk,iyi′(N−k),for 0⩽yi′⩽hcore, and(17)〈ui,cs〉=∑k=1Mck,iyi″(M−k),for 0⩽yi″⩽hcs, where bk,i and ck,i are the coefficients of the polynomials used in the core micro region and constrained region respectively.

In the shear-thickening case they have shown that solutions become non-differentiable at some critical location ηc, and although it transpires that this singularity can be regularised entirely within the context of the power-law model, we will not consider such flows here. Thus in this study we will consider flows with power-law index in the range 12<n⩽1. They have also shown that for 12<n<1 to ensure the correct algebraic decay in the numerical solutions one must apply the Robin condition(11)(u¯′,v¯′)=nη(n-1)(u¯,v¯)asη→∞,at some suitably large value of η=η∞≫1. In the Newtonian case this relationship becomes singular, this is due to the fact that when n=1 the functions u¯ and v¯ decay exponentially. Cochran [13] showed that in this case(12)(u¯′,v¯′)=w¯∞(u¯,v¯)asη→∞,where w∞=-2∫0∞u¯dη.

Another interesting application is the problem of dynamics, rewritten in first-order form, i.e. through a Hamiltonian description. It is of considerable interest to note from the outset that, due to the forward transport of information in time, it is always possible to consider a set of finite time intervals, whereby the solution at the end of any such interval will act as the initial data for the next one.

184,184,"Fig. 7 shows the relationship between the testing time and friction coefficients of various samples under dry conditions. There exist running in and steady wear period in the wear process of uncoated AZ31 and anodizing coating without Al2O3 nanoparticles while there has a steady wear period only in the wear process of composite anodizing coating with Al2O3 nanoparticles. At the same time, the addition of nano-particles to electrolyte led to reduction of friction coefficient. The friction coefficient of composite coating is relatively lower and more stable than what has been reported in literature [24,25] for anodizing coatings. This may be caused by “rolling effect” made by Al2O3 nanoparticles on the surface of oxide coating. Spherical nanoparticles change sliding into rolling, which reduce friction, making the friction coefficient becomes more stable. The friction coefficient of anodizing coating without Al2O3 nanoparticles has large fluctuation maybe for the damage of coating. In contrast to the uncoated AZ31 magnesium alloy, the anodizing coatings show slightly lower friction coefficient. This can be attributed to their higher load-bearing capacity for high hardness.

186,186,"EM sensors exploit the difference in magnetic properties, such as relative permeability, and electrical conductivity between samples with different microstructural phase balances. In ferromagnetic steels, the change in relative permeability has a significant effect. Previously, multi-frequency EM sensors have been shown to be able to measure austenite/ferrite fraction from 0% to 100% in model (HIPped austenitic/ferritc stainless steel powder) alloys [7,8]. The large difference in magnetic properties of ferrite (ferromagnetic) and austenite (paramagnetic) phases makes the change in signal large and hence relatively easy to measure. EM sensors have also measured the levels of decarburisation (variation in ferrite content with depth) in steel rod [9,10]. The approach adopted to relate the overall steel EM sensor signal to its microstructure has been to construct a finite element (FE) model for the microstructure (phase, region size and distribution). The EM properties of the individual phases are assigned to those regions to give the overall EM properties of the steel. Within the model the particular sensor geometry is included (e.g. two-dimensional axisymmetric for a cylindrical sample and tubular sensor [10]) and the interaction with the steel and any external circuits predicted.

187,187,"In summary, we have shown that one can describe the experimental data of the HERMES Collaboration for hadron attenuation on nuclei without invoking any changes in the fragmentation function due to gluon radiation. In our dynamical studies, that include the most relevant FSI, we employ only the ‘free’ fragmentation function on a nucleon and attribute the hadron attenuation to the deceleration of the produced (pre-)hadrons due to FSI in the surrounding medium. We find that in particular the z-dependence of RMh is very sensitive to the interaction cross section of leading prehadrons and can be used to determine σlead. The interaction of the leading prehadrons during the formation time could be interpreted as an in-medium change of the fragmentation function, which however could not be given in a closed form. The extracted average hadron formation times of τf≳0.3 fm/c are compatible with the analysis of antiproton attenuation in p+A reactions at AGS energies [17]. In an upcoming work we will investigate in detail the spectra for different particle species (π±,K±,p,p̄) to examine, if the formation times of mesons and antibaryons are about equal.

188,188,"An increase of neutron leakage from the core region can be achieved through modifications in the core geometry (usually by adopting a pan-cake geometry of the active core region at the expense of the general neutron economy). Extensive studies determined a set of core design modifications that optimised the total sodium void reactivity (becoming less positive). Among the most efficient design solutions identified is an enlarged sodium plenum above the active core region in combination with an absorber layer above the sodium plenum (to reduce neutron backscattering from the reflector region above the plenum). Fig. 19 shows the combined effect of different upper plenum thicknesses of the absorber and boron layers. It can be observed that the sequential increase of the layer's thickness converge to an asymptotic value of reactivity reduction slightly over 800pcm.

191,191,"As the progression towards smaller lithographic nodes continues it has become necessary to adopt thinner resist films to mitigate problems such as pattern collapse. To address the issue of reduced etch resistance of thin photoresist films the semiconductor industry has begun to develop multilayer processes where the pattern is first transferred into an intermediate organic hardmask with higher etch selectivity before final silicon pattern transfer [25–27]. In this paper we demonstrate how the introduction of such a multilayer process can also benefit nanosphere lithography by increasing achievable aspect ratios of silicon nanopillars without the need for complex etch processes requiring specialised and expensive equipment, but instead needing only a standard SF6/C4F8 inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mixed mode etch process at room temperature [28]. As intermediate layer material we used polyimide, which finds widespread use as encapsulation material for IC production. It is readily patterned in oxygen plasma and has a lower etch rate than silicon in SF6 gas. Its flexibility can also be used for the fabrication of soft polymer pillars by the same process as we will show. The multilayer process slightly increases the complexity of sample preparation but allows basic ICP etching to achieve high aspect ratio structures at smaller feature sizes that previously reported without the need for complex etching equipment.

192,192,"The wind speed and cloud height Markov chains are produced accounting for seasonal variations. A Markov chain is used for each variable representing each of the four seasons, capturing the variability at different times of the year, totalling four chains each. The okta number Markov chains also consider the effect of season, with the inclusion of impacts from pressure and diurnal variation. Eight okta Markov chains are produced that are split by above and below average pressure for each season, and four additional morning okta Markov chains are produced to capture the diurnal variation for okta transitions between 00:00 and 05:00am for each season. The intent is to capture the variation in transition probability that occurs as a result of weather changes due to the presence of solar energy. 5am is considered the cut-off because it is a typical sunrise in the summer for the applied study locations. 5h represents 5 okta transitions and is considered an appropriate duration for the slight propensity to shift towards an increased okta to be represented, Fig. 8 demonstrates the diurnal transition differences.

This is called the “Garden Sprinkler Effect” and has been extensively studied in [48,49,20]. (In the Boltzmann transport community this is known as the ray effect.) To showcase this effect in the angular dimension, a large spatial domain (4000km×4000km) is simulated, with a monochromatic wave propagating over a long distance in deep water (d=10000m). For the spatial discretisation a structured triangle mesh is used, with an element edge length of 67km (Fig. 11(a)). The initial wave field, located 500km from the lower and left side has a Gaussian distribution in space, with a significant wave height of Hs=2.5m and a standard deviation of 150km (Fig. 11(b)). Its mean direction is 30° with an angular distribution of cos2⁡(θ) and a frequency of 0.1Hz. The simulation is time-dependent and runs for 5 days with a time-step of 600s.

194,194,"The Magnox reactors represent the first generation of gas-cooled reactors in the UK that used carbon dioxide (CO2) as the primary coolant and a honeycomb network of graphite bricks to provide neutron moderation. During reactor operation significant amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) was produced from the CO2 coolant. This CO in turn can be radiolytically polymerised to form a carbonaceous deposit on free surfaces [12]. This non-graphitic carbon deposit is significantly more chemically reactive to air than the underlying graphite [12,13]. During the lifetime of some Magnox reactors, small quantities of methane gas were injected into the coolant gas to inhibit weight loss of the graphite core due to radiolytic oxidation [14]. Methane (CH4) is a precursor for carbonaceous deposits that form a sacrificial layer protecting the underlying graphite from excessive weight loss [15] and reduction in mechanical strength [16]. It is assumed nitrogen incorporation during deposit formation is the subsequent production route for the high 14C levels observed.

195,195,"We start by outlining the motivation, structure and content of the review. It has long been known that cardiovascular signals contain a number of oscillatory components that are not exactly periodic. To put it differently, their periods (frequencies) fluctuate with time. For example, heart rate variability (HRV) has in itself provided a major topic of discussion. We introduce one of the statistical approaches to HRV in Section 3. However, in order to understand the variability of the cardiovascular system, discussion of a single source is insufficient because the cardiovascular system is composed of many different physiological components (subsystems) and it is the effects of their mutual interaction that combine to produce HRV. This is demonstrated in Section 4, revealed by results obtained using the wavelet transform. In Section 5, we discuss the cardio-respiratory interaction in terms of phase synchronization. To set the scene for these later discussions, we summarize the basic principles of phase dynamics in Section 2. For readers who are unfamiliar with the physiological aspects of the research, we provide Appendices A on the cardiovascular system and B on how measurements of cardiovascular signals are conducted. Appendix C provides details of the statistical methods used in the group data analyses.

Further surprises came at the beginning of the century with the discovery of ferromagnetic superconductors in uranium systems [11] and the first observation of superconductivity in plutonium [12] and neptunium [13] compounds.

Initially, the micro-cracks may be dispersed in the model reflecting the random distribution of pore sizes and the low level of interaction due to force redistribution. Interaction and coalescence may follow as the population of micro-cracks increases. These situations are illustrated in Fig. 3. The structure of the failed surface can be represented with a mathematical graph, where graph nodes represent failed faces and graph edges exist between failed faces with common triple line in the cellular structure, i.e. where two micro-cracks formed a continuous larger crack. With reference to Fig. 3, each failed face is a graph node and each pair of neighbouring failed faces is a graph edge.

200,200,"Some methods use 1D radial profiles obtained from circular averaging of 2D experimental PSD [4,8,11] or by elliptical averaging [17]. An inadequacy of circular averaging is that it neglects astigmatism. Astigmatism distorts the circular shape of the Thon rings and thus decreases their modulation depth in the obtained 1D profile. A few algorithms that consider astigmatism involve concepts such as dividing the PSD into sectors where Thon rings are approximated by circular arcs [15,21], applying Canny edge detection to find the rings [17] prior to elliptical averaging, determining the relationship between the 1D circular averages with and without astigmatism [22], or using a brute-force scan of a database containing precalculated patterns as in ATLAS [23]. Some other approaches for estimating CTF parameters do a fully 2D PSD optimization [12,14,18,20] but they usually regulate and fit numerous parameters by an extensive search that does not guarantee convergence. Furthermore, only a few schemes that were developed for defocus estimation provide an error analysis [23,24].

202,202,"The most ambitious goal may be stated as the one of detecting the location of, say, one missing level on an otherwise complete sequence. Dyson, in a recent review [7], uses information theory concepts and argues that correlations in a sequence may provide the necessary redundancy from which error correcting codes can be constructed. At one extreme where no correlations and therefore no redundancy are present (Poissonian sequence), there is no possibility of detecting one missing level. At the other extreme, a sequence of equally spaced levels (picket fence), there is a maximum redundancy and a missed level can be obviously detected as a hole in the spectrum. Eigenvalues of random matrices, which exhibit characteristic correlations, correspond to an intermediate situation between these two extremes. The attempts to locate in the last case a single missed level have remained unsuccessful so far. However, it should be mentioned that for two-dimensional chaotic systems where, besides correlations of the order of one mean spacing as described by random matrices, the presence and the role of long range correlations governed by the shortest periodic orbits and reflected in Weyl's law describing the average spectral density, is well understood. It is then possible to approximately locate, from the study of spectral fluctuations, a single missed level [8].

The temperature range of the experiment was from 430.3 K to 1088.8 K using steps of 50 K. Each isothermal run consisted of 2–4 drops of Bi2UO6 samples, each surrounded by two drops of platinum from which the sensitivity of the device was determined. The drops were separated by time intervals of 20 min, long enough to re-stabilize the monitored heat flow signal. Background subtraction and peak integration were performed using commercially available software for data processing. The reported temperatures were corrected in accordance with the calibration curve obtained prior to measurement using several high purity standard metals (Sn, Pb, Zn, Al, Ag, Ni) with various melting temperatures in order to cover the whole temperature range of the measurement. After drop calorimetric measurements at the maximum considered temperature, the material was subjected to a new XRD measurement, confirming the stability of the compound under the experimental conditions.

207,207,"The next phase of our current study is to use the parameters obtained from pure-component systems in a transferable manner to represent the corresponding mixtures. Mixtures of n-alkanes and H2O have been studied previously with SAFT-γ SW [82]. In general it is well known that the extreme nature of the phase separation [150] makes it challenging to model mixtures of H2O with non-polar compounds. Because of the large differences in the dielectric constant of the two phases as well as in the dipole moment of H2O and the hydrophobic molecules, it especially difficult to obtain phase-independent unlike interaction parameters [112] and thus to model simultaneously the equilibrium phases. In previous work [82], emphasis was placed on obtaining an accurate description of the alkane-rich phases (both liquid and vapour), while small absolute (but not relative) deviations for the aqueous phase composition were achieved. The systems of interest in our current work are typically aqueous mixtures containing a high proportion of H2O, alkylamine, and CO2. Consequently, in order to provide an improved overall description of the fluid-phase equilibria at the conditions of interest, refinements have been made to the unlike parameters presented in the previous study [129] relating to the interactions between H2O and the alkyl groups, CH3 and CH2, namely ϵCH3,H2O, ϵCH2,H2O and λCH3,H2O, λCH2,H2O.

208,208,"The early theoretical work of Catlow assessed a number of Willis type clusters and found them all to be stable using potential-based methods [6]. More recently “split interstitial” type clusters (Fig. 1) have emerged from computational studies as stable species following the potential based investigation of Govers et al. which found the 2:2:2 cluster in a UO2 supercell relaxed to a split di-interstitial [13] (Fig. 1(b)); a single VO with three Oi displaced approximately 1.6Å in 〈111〉 directions from the VO. This result was later confirmed by the LSDA+U calculations of Geng et al. [7]. The family of split interstitial clusters was extended to include tri-interstitials [8] (a di-interstitial with the fourth Oi site occupied) and quad-interstitials [9] (two di-interstitials on adjacent sites, giving a total of two VO and six Oi) (Fig. 1(d)). Following this Andersson et al. postulated a model for U4O9 based on a UO2 supercell containing multiple split quad-interstitial clusters; following the prediction of their LSDA+U calculations that the quad-interstitial is more stable than its cuboctahedral counterpart [12].

209,209,"Our simulations confirm experimental observations that W net erosion represents only tiny fraction (in our simulation ∼1%) of the W gross erosion. The estimated upstream W fluxes, FWupstrem, are in good agreement with the experimentally observed values ⩽1019m-2s-1 [16]. Moreover, this value is not very sensitive to the divertor plasma temperature. For low temperatures the energy of D and C ions hitting to the divertor plates is too low to sputter sufficient amount of W. With increasing energy the W sputtering increases, but the potential drop in the divertor plasma increases too. As a result, most of the W atoms are ionized in the vicinity of the divertor and return back to the plates. There are two effects leading to the observed prompt redeposition of W ions: first is the “near-divertor” ionization of W due to low ionization potential −7.86eV (for comparison the ionization potentials for D and C are 13,6 and 10.6eV), second, W+n ions have large Larmor radius ∼2/nmm, so that they are redeposited within the distance of a Larmor radius. Important to note that a significant fraction of W ions escaping this prompt redeposition are returned back due to the friction with the main ions.

The numerical test cases presented therein are for symmetric potentials for which we cannot provide reliable, i.e. well-resolved, results due to the presence of singular terms in the steady state Wigner functions, see Section 4.3. Other recent studies demonstrate the convergence of the WTE calculations upon increasing the size of the simulation domain [44] as well as possible improvements by adapting the boundary distribution to the physical state of the active device region [47]. Despite their approximate nature we employ inflow/outflow boundary conditions here as well and demonstrate that accurate and physically valid results can be achieved for sufficiently large values of Lres.

212,212,"Traditionally, the simulation of incompressible fluid flow by the SPH method has been through a weakly compressible SPH formulation (WCSPH). In this approach, the pressure is treated as a thermodynamic variable and is calculated using an artificial equation of state. The sound speed is set to be sufficiently high to limit density variations to within a small fraction of the actual fluid density. In practice, this high sound speed places a limitation on the maximum permissible time-step size through the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) constraint. A particular weakness relates to noise in the pressure field since a small perturbation in the local density will yield a large variation in the local pressure. This can make WCSPH formulations ineffective for accurate force and pressure prediction, although recent developments which create more uniform particle distributions have improved this [1,2]. A review of the SPH method can be found in [3] while a review of the classical WCSPH formulation applied to free-surface flows can be found in [4].

216,216,"When incompatible three component polymer chains are tethered at a junction point, the resultant star molecules of the ABC type are in a very frustrated field in bulk. That is, their junction points cannot be aligned on two-dimensional planes but on one-dimensional lines, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, when the chain length difference is not so large, the array of junction points tends to be straight and long one. Consequently each domain with mesoscopic sizes becomes cylinders, and their cross sections could be conformed by polygons [28,29]. This is because three interfaces, A/B, B/C and C/A are likely to be flat since there exist no junction points at interfaces and therefore chain entropy contribution to the free energy of structure formation is considerably small comparing with regular block and graft copolymer systems. As a matter of fact, Dotera predicted several tiling patterns by the diagonal bond method, a new Monte Carlo Simulation [30], while Gemma and Dotera pointed out that only three regular tilings, i.e., (6.6.6), (4.8.8) and (4.6.12) are permitted for three-branched molecules proposed as the “even polygon theorem” [31].

217,217,"Geomagnetic jerks are conspicuous yet poorly understood phenomena of Earth’s magnetic field, motivating investigations of their morphology and the theory behind their origins. Jerks are most commonly defined by their observed form at a single observatory as ‘V’ shapes in a single component of the geomagnetic secular variation (SV), the first time derivative of the main magnetic field (MF). The times of the gradient changes, which separate linear trends of several years, have associated step changes in the second time derivative of the MF (secular acceleration (SA)) and impulses in the third time derivative. The ‘V’ shape SV definition of jerks includes an implicit expectation of a ‘large’ magnitude step change in the gradient without definition of this scale or its threshold value other than the basic need for it to be observable in the data above the highly variable background noise. Jerks can be described by their amplitude, that is, the difference in the gradients of the two linear SV segments about a jerk, A=a2-a1, where a2 is the gradient after the jerk and a1 is the gradient before the jerk. This measure is essentially the best fit SA change across a jerk. Jerk amplitude is thus positive for a positive step in SA and negative for a negative step. Here we do not consider spatial extent in our definition and refer to individual features in one field component of a given observatory time series as a single jerk.

218,218,"One of the great successes of the experimental program carried out at LEP has been to put a firm lower bound on the Higgs mass, mH>114 GeV [1], and at the same time, together with the information coming from SLD, to give a strong indirect evidence that the Higgs boson, the still missing particle of the Standard Model (SM), should be relatively light with a high probability for its mass to be below 200 GeV. The search for the Higgs boson is one of the main objective of the Tevatron and the future Large Hadron Collider (LHC), that are supposed to span all the Higgs mass regions up to 1 TeV. At hadron colliders the main Higgs production mechanism is the gluon fusion [2], a process whose knowledge is fundamental in order to put limits on the Higgs mass or, in case the Higgs is discovered, to compare the measured cross section with the SM result. Concerning the Higgs decay channels, it is quite difficult for an hadron collider to access part of the mass range favored by the LEP results, the so-called intermediate Higgs mass region 114≲mH≲160 GeV, because of the large QCD background to the dominant modes.

219,219,"The thermodynamics of copper-zinc alloys (brass) was subject of numerous investigations. Brass is characterised by an excess enthalpy and excess entropy of mixing, both of which are negative. The enthalpic data were measured by solution calorimetry e.g., [1–3] and based on chemical potential data calculated from phase equilibrium experiments e.g., [4–6], the excess entropy of mixing could be evaluated e.g., [7–9]. This excess entropy contains both, the vibrational and the configurational parts. The excess vibrational entropy, defined as the deviation from the entropy of a mechanical mixture of the end members A and B (i.e., Smmechmix=XASmA+XBSmB), can be determined by measuring the low temperature heat capacity (5 to 300K) versus composition behaviour. The determination of the excess configurational entropy, i.e., the excess entropy coming from non-random atomic distributions and defects, is much more difficult. Here, neutron scattering investigations together with computer simulations are normally used. If, however, reliable data of the total excess entropy (from enthalpic and chemical potential data) are available, the measurement of the excess vibrational entropy enables the determination of the excess configurational entropy simply by subtraction. Since configurational and vibrational entropies may have different temperature dependencies, it is worthwhile to separate the entropic effects. This is one aim of this study. Another aim is to deliver experimental data so that first principles studies can test their models on a disordered alloy, whose structural details (short-range order) depend on temperature.

Layers deposited by this technique have been used in electromagnetic wave shielding, in the metallization process of through-holes in printed wiring boards, and in the manufacture of conducting polymers (such as Teflon) [37,38,39]. An advantage of this dip-coating process is that it can be used for any kind of surface, provided the substrate is stable in water and that the particles used for the coating form a meta-stable dispersion. Recently, a non-aqueous SIC coating process of carbon black was developed by investigating the stabilities of non-aqueous dispersions [36].

221,221,"Anodizing processes are widely used for protecting aluminium alloys against corrosion [1]. The resultant films are composed of amorphous alumina and consist of a relatively thick, porous, outer region and a thinner, non-porous, inner region [2,3]. The porous region contains the major pores of the film, which extend from the film surface to the barrier layer. Near the film surface, shorter, incipient pores are also present, whose growth stopped in the early stages of anodizing. The diameter of the major pores and the thickness of the inner, barrier region are dependent on the potential applied during anodizing, with typical proportionalities of ∼1nmV−1 [3,4]. Studies of ionic migration in barrier-type and porous anodic alumina films have usually found a transport number of O2− ions of ∼0.6 [5,6]. During the formation of porous films, the outward migrating Al3+ ions, constituting the remainder of the ionic current, are ejected to the electrolyte at the pore bases [7]. The electronic current in the barrier region is generally considered to be negligible. The thickness of the barrier region, which is relatively constant during the growth of a film under either a constant potential or constant current density, is maintained by a balance between growth of the barrier layer by continued oxidation of the aluminium substrate and thinning of the barrier layer by either field-assisted dissolution of the alumina at the pore bases [8] or field-assisted flow of alumina from the barrier layer to the pore walls [9–13]. The pores may be widened toward the film surface by chemical dissolution to an extent dependent on the anodizing conditions.

This paper proposes a new form of high dimensional model representation (HDMR) by utilizing the support vector regression (SVR), termed as adaptive SVR-HMDR, to conquer this dilemma. The proposed model could reveal explicit correlations among different input variables of the underlying function which is unknown or expensive for computation. Taking advantage of HDMR's hierarchical structure, it could alleviate the exponential increasing difficulty, and gain satisfying accuracy with small set of samples by SVR.

223,223,"In order to study the mechanical behavior of metal films on compliant polymer substrates, fragmentation testing is often employed [8–12]. During fragmentation testing, the film-substrate couple is strained under uni-axial tension and observed with light microscopy (LM) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Brittle metals or ceramic films fracture, forming through thickness cracks (channel cracks) at low strain perpendicular to the straining direction. On the other hand, ductile metal films will first deform locally in the form of necks at low strains (Fig. 1a) and with increased strain through thickness cracks (TTC) can evolve (Fig. 1b). Fragmentation testing is best performed in-situ with LM or SEM so that the strain when the first crack forms can be observed. The initial fracture strain of the film, also known as the crack onset strain, can then be used to determine the interfacial fracture shear stress with knowledge of the crack spacing at saturation, λ, film thickness, h, and the fracture stress, σf=Efilmεf, where εf is the fracture strain, using the shear lag model [8,13,14]. In-situ fragmentation testing with LM or SEM allows for the crack spacing evolution to be observed as a function of applied strain (Fig. 1c). Under tensile straining conditions, a brittle film will initially fracture at very low strains (<1%) and then with further strain continue to form cracks until the saturation crack spacing is reached. After the saturation spacing has been reached, cracks can no longer form between existing crack fragments and the film could delaminate via buckling.

229,229,"The main objective of this manuscript is to present and discuss the application of SLAMM to the New York coast. Although the base analysis considers a range of different possible SLR scenarios, the effects of various sources of uncertainties such as input parameters and driving data are not accounted for. In addition, refined and site-specific data are often not available requiring the use of regional data collected from literature and professional judgement in order to run the model. To ignore the effects of these uncertainties on predictions may make interpretation of the results and subsequent decision making misleading since the likelihood and probabilities of predicted outcomes would be unknown. A unique capability of the current version of SLAMM is the ability to aggregate multiple types of input-data uncertainty to create outputs accompanied by probability statements and confidence intervals. Uncertainty in elevation data layers have been considered by several modeling groups to various extents (Gesch, 2009; Gilmer and Ferdaña, 2012; Schmid et al., 2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, no other marsh migration model simultaneously accounts for the combined effects of uncertainty in spatial inputs (DEM, VDATUM, etc.) and parameter choices (accretion rates, tide ranges, etc.) on landcover projections. This added feature of SLAMM allows results to be evaluated in terms of their likelihood of occurrence with respect to input-data and parameter uncertainties. Further, by assigning wide ranges of uncertainty when appropriate, it permits the production of meaningful projections in areas where high-quality local data are not available.

230,230,"Power and particle exhaust are crucial for the viability of any future fusion power plant concept. Heat in fusion reactors must be extracted through a wall and cannot be exhausted volumetrically, which limits the allowed power density in fusion reactors [1] and is a severe technical challenge in itself [2]. In addition, structural material changes resulting from neutron irradiation cause degradation in the heat exhaust capabilities of existing designs [3] and static surfaces can suffer severely from erosion due to impinging plasma particles [4,5]. It is concluded that conventional concepts and materials for plasma facing components (PFCs) reach their limits in terms of material lifetime and power exhaust at approximately 20MW/m2, which is presumably dramatically reduced to <10MW/m2 due to neutron damage in a D-T reactor [6] or even only half that value [7].

The wall system (denoted as flexi-wall) consists of stay-in-place poly-blocks as formwork, light polyurethane foam (LPF) reinforced with steel rebars as structural cores and polyurea as a coating of the wall surfaces (Fig. 1). Poly-blocks are interlocking light-weight blocks which are stacked up layer by layer and act as formwork for the LPF cores. The poly-block is 20×20×80cm3 and includes four cylindrical voids with 14cm diameter. It is made of molded low-density polyurethane and weighs approximately 1kg. The poly-blocks are fire-resistant blocks and have an excellent capability to absorb, mitigate and reflect a wide range of noises with unmatched frequency of reflective noise. Polyurea coating is an abrasion-resistant finishing layer, which is sprayed on the surfaces of the wall and sets within 2–3min. This layer also enhances the surface resistance of poly-blocks against stone impact, weathering, fire development, chemicals and penetration. LPF is an expanding liquid mixture which is injected into the poly-block voids and cures within 10min. Steel rebars are epoxied into holes drilled in the existing sound wall to connect the wall extension to its base.

232,232,"There are a number of avenues to explore for future work, in particular the use of other time–frequency analysis methods. The STFT spectrogram was utilised here, as it is the simplest to implement. Whilst all of the echoes could be clearly resolved in both time and frequency, the spectrogram suffers from a fixed resolution, i.e. an increase of time resolution necessarily leads to a decrease in frequency resolution. Other methods of time–frequency analysis, such as discrete wavelet analysis, benefit from advantage of multi-resolution analysis, which offers improved temporal resolution of the high frequency components, and frequency resolution of the low frequency components [25,18,19]. Also, whilst the current work has utilised SH waves that are generated by EMATs, the physics that describes the pulsed array system is universal to other types of waves. Future work will include demonstrating this phenomenon with a number of other systems, for example using longitudinal ultrasonic waves or electromagnetic waves.

233,233,"Discovering that both the vacancy and interstitial defect migration pathways are confined to Ga-free regions suggests changes in recombination rates of isolated vacancy-interstitial pairs in comparison to pure Pu. The degree to which the rates are effected depends on the distribution of residual defects post a cascade event, in addition to the concentration and ordering of the Ga atoms. If vacancies and interstitials become greatly separated after the collision cascade, then pathways to recombination are likely to become restricted and recovery times will be extended. This is viable for cascades that created a vacancy rich core surrounded by dispersed interstitials, as found for the low energy cascades in Pu and PuGa [11,12]. This may also be the case for channelling events, where energetic atoms travel deep into the lattice through channels of low atomic density.

Such tests include studies of the nitrogen exchange reaction [14] both adiabatic by running trajectories on the lowest surfaces and non-adiabatic by using the trajectory surface hoping (TSH) method [22,23] for transitions to the excited state of same symmetry. It was concluded that nonadiabatic transitions could not make a significant impact on the rate coefficients, and therefore all trajectories here reported are independently integrated for each symmetry on the corresponding lowest adiabatic PES. In fact, we have tested the impact of running the trajectories starting on the upper sheets, and found no vibrational transition to take place, only small amounts of rotational energy is exchanged in this case. Also neglected are electronic transitions to the quartet state which are believed to be far less probable than the simple vibrational energy transfer here studied due to their spin-forbidden character. It should also be noted that the use of quasiclassical trajectories is justified by the large masses of the atoms involved [24].

235,235,"Generalized polynomial chaos expansions. One approach to model densities with stochastically dependent components numerically, is to reformulate the uncertainty problem as a set of independent components through generalised polynomial chaos expansion [34]. As described in detail in Section 3.1, a Rosenblatt transformation allows for the mapping between any domain and the unit hypercube [0, 1]D. With a double transformation we can reformulate the response function f asf(x,t,Q)=f(x,t,TQ−1(TR(R)))≈fˆ(x,t,R)=∑n∈INcn(x,t)Φn(R),where R is any random variable drawn from pR, which for simplicity is chosen to consists of independent components. Also, {Φn}n∈IN is constructed to be orthogonal with respect to LR, not LQ. In any case, R is either selected from the Askey-Wilson scheme, or calculated using the discretized Stieltjes procedure. We remark that the accuracy of the approximation deteriorate if the transformation composition TQ−1∘TR is not smooth [34]. Dakota, Turns, and Chaospy all support generalized polynomial chaos expansions for independent stochastic variables and the Normal/Nataf copula listed in Table 2. Since Chaospy has the Rosenblatt transformation underlying the computational framework, generalized polynomial chaos expansions are in fact available for all densities.

238,238,"Owing to widespread availability, the most extensively adopted tomography technique utilizes the milling power of a focused ion beam (FIB) in conjunction with the imaging capabilities of high resolution FE-SEM, to provide a sequence of 2D images that can be effectively re-combined in 3D space. However, because this technique is destructive, studies of microstructural evolution are influenced by inherent sample variability. Non-destructive X-ray nano-computed tomography (CT) [9–11] provides a platform for exploring dynamic microstructural change in the absence of these possible complications and is compatible with both laboratory and synchrotron radiation. The authors have previously demonstrated a technique for preparation of optimal sample geometries for X-ray nano-CT [12], while this FIB sample preparation route will involve the selective removal of portions of the fuel cell electrode microstructure (and therefore may be destructive to the working fuel cell), the non-destructive X-ray characterization technique allows repeated, non-destructive characterization of the selected sample which facilitates the study of microstructural evolution processes in response to various environmental changes.

239,239,"In these frameworks, however, the physical spacetime dimension is an input rather than a prediction of the theory. In fact, in standard theories whose gravitational sector is described by the Einstein–Hilbert action, there is no obstruction to perform dimensional reductions to spacetimes of dimensions d≠4. Then the question arises, since eleven-dimensional Minkowski space is a maximally (super)symmetric state, and the theory is well-behaved around it, why the theory does not select this configuration as the vacuum, but instead, it chooses a particular compactified space with less symmetry. An ideal situation, instead, would be that the eleven-dimensional theory dynamically predicted a low energy regime which could only be a four-dimensional effective theory. In such a scenario, a background solution with an effective spacetime dimension d>4 should be expected to be a false vacuum where the propagators for the dynamical fields are ill-defined, lest a low energy effective theory could exist in dimensions higher than four.

240,240,"The exquisite manipulation and exact measurement of properties of individual nanomaterials, compared with notable progress in their preparation, have not been thoroughly addressed albeit being of prime importance for the sustained development of new devices [58–61]. To date, several instruments have been designed for such goals, namely, scanning electron microscopes (SEM), atomic force microscopes (AFM) and transmission electron microscopes (TEM) [62,63]. Compared with the first two setups, which have no direct access to the material internal structure and atomic bonding information [64–67], the state-of-the-art in situ high-resolution TEM technique allows one to not only manipulate with an individual object at the nano-scale precision but to also get deep insights into its physical, chemical, and microstructural statuses [68–71]. Combining the capabilities of a conventional high-resolution TEM and AFM or STM probes produces advanced and dedicated TEM holders, which are becoming the powerful tools in nanomaterials manipulation and properties analysis. Such holders have been commercialized, for instance, by “Nanofactory Instruments AB’’, Goteborg, Sweden [72]. The full usefulness of these advanced in-situ TEM techniques is apparent with respect to mechanical and thermal property analysis of individual nanostructures, e.g., elasticity, plasticity and strength data while employing direct bent or tensile tests [73–75], probing electrical characteristics, e.g., field emission [27,76,77], electrical transport tracing [78–80], soldering [81,82], and doping [83], etc.

242,242,"A key part of this problem is that an inspector only has access to data from a small inspected area. In this area, there is only one minimum thickness, which does not provide enough information to build a model of the smallest thicknesses. An inspector can generate a sample of the smallest thickness measurements by partitioning the inspection data into a number of equally sized blocks. In each block the minimum thickness is recorded. This set forms a sample of the smallest thickness measurements. From this sample, one can build a model which takes into account the variations of the smallest thickness measurements. Extreme value analysis (EVA) provides a limiting form for this model. It states that, if the underlying thickness measurements in each block are taken from independent and identical distributions, then the sample of minimum thickness measurements will follow a generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD).

Regioselectivity of second cycloaddition was predicted using the atomic orbital coefficients corresponding to HOMOylide–LUMOylide–pyrene. According to Fukui [33], reactions can be favorable in the direction of maximal HOMO–LUMO overlapping of larger coefficients at the reactive sites. The most favorable interactions between corresponding ylides and ylidepyrene adducts to form the most favorable regioisomer conformation are given in Fig. 3. Second ylide addition to ylidepyrene structure is therefore anticipated to proceed via ylideC2/C6–ylidepyrene-C3 and ylideC7–ylidepyrene/C2 interactions to produce the same regioisomer conformations.

The LSMB is mounted on flexures which provide flexibility in the horizontal direction so that the majority of the lateral force is transmitted though the much stiffer load path which contains the load cell as shown in Fig. 2. Both displacement and load sensors have been calibrated (both externally and in-situ) in static conditions. The load and displacement signals are sampled at a rate of two hundred measurements per fretting cycle at all fretting frequencies, with these data being used to generate fretting loops. The loops were used to derive the contact slip amplitude and the energy coefficient of friction in each cycle according to the method suggested by Fouvry et al. [17].

For example, Gregory and Walker [1] discuss how the introduction of suction extends the laminar-flow region over a swept wing by reducing the thickness of the boundary layer and the magnitude of crossflow velocity. Conclusions for the swept-wing flow arose from equivalent studies of the von Kármán (rotating disk) flow (see Gregory and Walker [2], Stuart [3]) and work has since continued into this and related flows using numerical and asymptotic approaches (see Ockendon [4], Dhanak [5], Bassom and Seddougui [6], Lingwood [7], Turkyilmazoglu [8], Lingwood and Garrett [9], for example). The literature shows that increasing suction has a stabilising effect on the general class of “Bödewadt, Ekman and von Kármán” (BEK) flows which results in an increase in critical Reynolds numbers for the onset of convective and absolute instabilities, a narrowing in the range of unstable parameters and a decrease in amplification rates of the unstable convective modes. The convective instability results are interpreted in terms of a delay in the onset of spiral vortices, and the absolute instability results in terms of the onset of laminar-turbulent transition (Lingwood [7,10,11]).

248,248,"The boundary element method (BEM) has clear advantages when applied to shape optimisation of high-voltage devices, see [4–8] for an introduction to BEM. First of all, BEM relies only on a surface discretisation so that there is no need to maintain an analysis-suitable volume discretisation during the shape optimisation process. Moreover, BEM is ideal for solving problems in unbounded domains that occur in electrostatic field analysis. In gradient-based shape optimisation the shape derivative of the cost functional with respect to geometry perturbations is needed [9–11]. To this purpose, we use the adjoint approach and solve the primary and the adjoint boundary value problems with BEM. The associated linear systems of equations are dense and an acceleration technique, such as the fast multipole method [12,13], is necessary for their efficient solution. For some recent applications of fast BEM in shape optimisation and Bernoulli-type free-boundary problems we refer to [14–16].

250,250,"We have demonstrated a new approach to the manufacture of self-folding hydrogel scaffolds by the use of readily available and fast throughput methods. The process shows effective pattern transfer by first embossing a sacrificial layer and using it as a soluble mould in the fabrication process. The use of a sacrificial layer of PAA imparts environmental sensitivity to the hydrogel film on only one surface. The subsequent swelling of the PAA inter-penetrating network (IPN) in elevated pH causes a swelling differential across the film, causing it to roll to accommodate the difference in surface area between the two surfaces. The surface functionalization and patterning stages are thus combined into one photolithographic operation. The net result is a method of producing environmentally triggered self-folding all hydrogel scaffolds by a, to the authors’ knowledge, novel use of sacrificial layer embossing. The patterned hydrogel films can be triggered consecutively allowing for successive rolling and unrolling depending on the aqueous pH. The choice of PEGDMA hydrogel provides a versatile platform for creating a variety of hydrogel scaffolds, and while being non-fouling and nontoxic it is permeable to proteins. Furthermore PEGDMA can be modified to produce biodegradable and cell adhesive hydrogels for a variety of biomedical applications.

255,255,"There is still some debate about the crystal structure and composition of the fine oxides found in ODS steels and a number of different phases have been both proposed and identified. A complete characterisation of the oxide particles, including crystal structure and composition, is needed as different phases and chemical variants of a single structure have been shown to respond differently to high temperatures and irradiation. Ribis and de Carlan [6] have studied the coarsening characteristics of Y2O3 and Y2Ti2O7 oxides at high temperatures. They show that the increase in particle size is greater for the non-Ti containing phase. Similarly, Ratti et al. [9], although they do not allude to specific oxide phases, have shown that small Ti additions to an 18%Cr ODS alloy dramatically reduces the coarsening rates of dispersoids when compared to an equivalent alloy without titanium. For example, Ribis indicates that coarsening rates may be controlled by interfacial energy between the secondary phase particles and the matrix; he points out that the resistance to coarsening observed in the Y, Ti, O system is probably the result of a very low interface energy and this would differ from one phase to another.

256,256,"The most widely used ion source in FIB instruments is a gallium (Ga) liquid metal ion source (LMIS) [1]. Gallium is attractive as an ion source because of its low melting temperature (29.8°C at standard atmospheric pressure [4]) and its low volatility [1]. However, some materials show sensitivity to the Ga ion beam. This sensitivity is manifested as changes in the structure and chemical composition of the starting material upon exposure to the Ga ion beam [5]. Group III–V compound semiconductors are one class of materials that show such sensitivity. Cryo-FIB milling has recently been reported to suppress the reactions between the Ga ion beam and III–V materials [6]. The suggested advantage of cryo-FIB milling over room temperature milling of Group III–V materials is appealing, given the variety of present and potential future applications for these materials (e.g., as electronic or photonic devices given the favorable electron transport and direct band gap properties associated with several III–V semiconductor systems).

257,257,"The above discussion also lays bare the difference of perspectives between the fusion of hard constraints and knowledge-base merging: the idea of Konieczny and Pino-Perez is to explain the fusion of plain epistemic states, understood as a set of plausible worlds, by the existence of underlying partial orderings or numerical plausibility degrees (obtained by distances), based on axioms that only use plausible sets attached to these orderings. In [67] the same authors use both hard (integrity) constraints and belief sets referring to plausible worlds, and try to extend both the AGM revision and knowledge-based merging. However, they do not envisage the merging of integrity constraints discussed in the previous section. The belief revision and merging literature takes an external point of view on cognitive processes under study. The underlying ordered structures are here a consequence of the merging postulates, but they do not appear explicitly in the axioms and they are not observable from the outside. On the contrary, our approach is to construct fusion rules that only rely on what is explicitly supplied by sources. In the sequel we consider the counterpart of our fusion postulates for ranked models, that can be expressed by means of total orders of possible worlds or by their encodings on a plausibility scale.

258,258,"To address the vertical displacement estimation of conventional pile groups subjected to mechanical loads, various numerical and analytical methods have been proposed. These methods include the finite element method [e.g., 2,3], the boundary element method [e.g., 4,5], the finite difference method [e.g., 6], the interaction factor method [e.g., 7,8–11], the equivalent pier and raft methods [e.g., 12–14], and the settlement ratio method [e.g., 15]. The finite element method, while providing the most rigorous and exhaustive representation of the pile group-related problem, is generally computationally expensive and considered mainly a research tool rather than a design tool. Conversely, the versatility of simplified (approximate) methods, such as the interaction factor approach that allows capturing the (e.g., vertical) displacements of any general pile group by the analysis of the displacement interaction between two identical piles and by the use of the elastic principle of superposition of effects, makes them attractive as design tools because they allow for the use of expedient parametric studies under various design conditions.

It also enables monitoring of optical changes during the measurement in real time. However, the asymmetrical heating from the bottom side and local cooling (e.g. by convection, radiation, and the contacting tip acting as a heat sink) is known to cause temperature gradients within the sample [11].

In this report, film thickness measurements were made for IM-HM11-01 and IM-HM11-02 films, whilst IM-HM11-03 was used for etching; further investigations to compare the performance of the different compositions across tasks are underway. Films of the SoC were prepared by spin coating on hydrogen-terminated silicon substrates with a speed varying between 800 and 2000 RPM for 60s. After spin coating the film was baked for 2min at temperatures of up to 330°C. In order to enable further processing, the SoC should be rendered insoluble in typical solvents for resist and spin-on-hardmask to enable further processing. The elution behavior of films of IM-HM11-01 and IM-HM11-02 for thicknesses between 30 and 325nm was tested as a function of the baking temperature.

Prior to baking the thickness of IM-HM11-01 was ∼320nm, and the thickness of IM-HM11-02 was ∼250nm. For temperatures above 190°C the IM-HM11-02 film was rendered insoluble, whilst a temperature of 260°C was required to achieve the same for IM-HM11-01.

For continuous characteristics, direct averages are used; for binary characteristics, the proportions of cell phone plans containing the feature are used. The resulting prices for this average cell phone plan are converted to an index by applying previously calculated pure price changes (δs). Finally, the overall hedonic price index is calculated as the weighted average of firm-level indices. Weights correspond to the relative proportion of cell phone plans by operator in the sample (0.3534 for HT, 0.3212 for Vip, and 0.3254 for Tele2).

On this basis, the DG polynomial accuracy is spanned by a set of coefficients, describing accuracy information, which are all locally evolved in time from conservation principles at the discrete level, with an arbitrary order of accuracy.

The results show that the coupled RTE model describes light propagation accurately in comparison with the Monte Carlo method.

The AC pavement composite permittivity reduces, along with the reflection coefficient, as the volumetric proportion of air increases as compared to the remaining components. However, the method relies on an empirical fit, determined on a case-by-case basis, since the permittivity of the remaining components depends on the mix design (aggregate type, binder content, etc.). Long term studies in Finland concluded that this empirical fit is an exponential relationship [1]. The exponential fits, using a sufficient amount of cores, can be used to map the air void content variation in a similar manner to the dielectric maps shown in Fig. 4. Only 4 cores were feasible due to various factors involved with testing the final lift of an in-service pavement. More cores are needed for more stable exponential coefficients, although the limited cores show that the predicted relationships are similar for the measured dielectric range in this case-study.

272,272,"To conclude, the electrochemical reduction of uranium dioxide to uranium metal has been studied in a lithium chloride–potassium chloride eutectic molten salt at 450°C. Both electrochemical and synchrotron X-ray techniques have been utilised to deduce the electrochemical reduction potential, mechanism and reduction pathway. The electrochemical reduction potential of the UO2|U couple is dependent on the activity of oxide ions existing within the melt. The electrochemical reduction of uranium dioxide to uranium metal seems to occur in a single, 4-electron-step, process; indicated by a single reduction peak (C1) in the cyclic voltammograms and also by the exclusion of any other phases in the EDXD data. The electrochemical reduction may be impeded by an increase in oxo-acidity of the molten salt. That is, O2− ions that are liberated by the electroreduction may not react at the counter electrode and, thus, not be removed from the molten salt. This could be due to the electrode geometry and/or the inherent microstructure of the working electrode: a high tortuosity, for example, would impede the diffusion of O2− ions out of the working electrode. This could then cause an increase in the activity of oxide ions existing within the melt and hence inhibit the electrochemical reduction – exploration of the microstructure of working electrodes will be the focus of future work.

It also clearly indicates through numerical simulations and applications to bearing monitoring that the expansion from standard EMD to multivariate EMD is a successful exploration. Using multiple sensors to collect signal from different locations of the machine and using the multivariate EMD to analyze multivariate signal can contribute to comprehensively collect all the frequency components related to any bearing fault, and is beneficial to extract fault information, especially for early weak fault characteristics. Both the characteristic frequencies of simulated signal and the fault frequencies of practical rolling bearing signal can be extracted from the same order of IMF groups, thus showing that multivariate EMD is an effective signal decomposition algorithm and can be competently applied to fault diagnosis of rolling bearings when combined with a multiscale reduction method and fault correlation factor analysis. In signal acquisition and processing, given the circumstance that there is a trend toward the use of multiple sensors, multivariate EMD appears to be very useful and meaningful as a kind of multivariate data processing algorithm. By analyzing the simulated signal and two different practical multivariate signals, the results demonstrate the significance of the proposed method in the field of fault diagnosis of rolling bearing.

275,275,"Immunopotentiators activate innate immunity directly (for example, cytokines) or through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs, such as those for bacterial components). The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of PRRs that are an important link between innate and adaptive immunity. Some studies have shown that TLR ligands have adjuvant activity and enhance antigen-specific antibody and cell-mediated immune responses, especially when they are combined with delivery systems that promote their uptake and delivery into antigen-presenting cells [22–24]. For clinical studies, TLR9 is generally stimulated with synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing one or more unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. In humans, CpG has been used as an adjuvant for infectious disease vaccination [25,26] and in the development of cancer therapy [27]. In a mouse model, CpG has also been shown to induce T helper 1 (Th1) immune responses, which are characterized by the production of IFN-γ and the generation of IgG2a [28,29]. Moreover, a previous study had demonstrated that different liposomes with CpG ODN significantly increased Th1-biased cytokines and augmented cell mediated immune response [30].

276,276,"Previous studies have shown that there are two main mechanisms for the development of radiation-induced DSBs [16,17]. For γ-ray radiation, single step is the main process to cause DSBs (see Figure 3b), which is attributed to the generation of number of ROS upon the incident of individual photon of γ-ray. Whereas photo-radiation causes DSBs through two step mechanism (Figure 3a) by reflecting that each single photon causes mostly single ROS and thus induces only single strand break. Then, when a second single strand break occurs where near the existing single strand break, DBS is caused, i.e., the two step mechanism. Summarizing the results and discussion we may conclude as that: (1) The significant protective effect of AA against photo-induced damage may reflect the effective diminish of ROS by AA. (2) For the γ-ray induced DSB, the protective effect by AA is a little bit weaker than the case of photo irradiation. This may be due to the generation of numbers of ROS by single photon of γ-ray. Surviving oxygen species against the diminishment effect by AA may cause DSBs. (3) As for the DSBs by ultrasound, damage is caused by the shockwave through the generation of cavitations [18]. Thus, the chemical effect of AA to diminish ROS is considered to be negligibly small for the protection of DSBs.

277,277,"We propose an equilibrium model that allows to analyze the long-run impact of the electricity market design on transmission line expansion by the regulator and investment in generation capacity by private firms in liberalized electricity markets. The model incorporates investment decisions of the transmission system operator and private firms in expectation of an energy-only market and cost-based redispatch. In different specifications we consider the cases of one vs. multiple price zones (market splitting) and analyze different approaches to recover network cost—in particular lump sum, generation capacity based, and energy based fees. In order to compare the outcomes of our multilevel market model with a first best benchmark, we also solve the corresponding integrated planner problem. Using two test networks we illustrate that energy-only markets can lead to suboptimal locational decisions for generation capacity and thus imply excessive network expansion. Market splitting heals these problems only partially. These results are valid for all considered types of network tariffs, although investment slightly differs across those regimes.

278,278,"Myocardial electrical propagation can be simulated using the monodomain or bidomain PDEs [5,6]. Due to its capacity to represent complex geometries with ease, approximations are often obtained using the finite element method (FEM) to discretise the PDEs in space on realistic cardiac geometry meshes; this results in very large (up to forty-million degrees of freedom (DOF) for human heart geometries) systems of linear equations which must be solved many thousands of times over the course of even a short simulation. Thus, they are extremely computationally demanding, presenting taxing problems even to high-end supercomputing resources. This computational demand means that effort has been invested in developing efficient solution techniques, including work on preconditioning, parallelisation and adaptivity in space and time [7–12]. In this study, we investigate the potential of reducing the number of DOF by using a high-order polynomial FEM [13–15] to approximate the monodomain PDE in space, with the goal of significantly improving simulation efficiency over the piecewise-linear FEM approach commonly used in the field [16–19]. For schemes where the polynomial degree p of the elements is adjusted according to the error in the approximation, this is known as the finite element p-version. In the work presented here, we work with schemes which keep p fixed.

To achieve this, large eddy simulations (LES) of a horizontal turbulent channel flow laden with five different particle shapes, incorporating the drag, lift and toque model derived in Zastawny et al. (2012), are performed. The well-documented horizontal channel flow case described in Kussin and Sommerfeld (2002), who study spherical particles, is used as a reference case. The measurements in their work was done with phase Doppler anemometry (PDA), to measure the fluid and particle velocity simultaneously. The numerical framework applied in this paper has been previously validated for spherical particles in Mallouppas and van Wachem (2013). In that paper, it is shown that the comprehensive discrete element model (DEM) is more accurate in determining the behaviour of the particles in this horizontal gas–solid channel flow that the hard-sphere model. Moreover, this paper showed that the fluid mechanics are accurately modelled using the LES framework. In the current paper, this framework is extended to account for non-spherical particles.

The first goal of the present article is the identification of these notions with well defined phase space dividing surfaces attached to NHIMs. The second and main goal is an elucidation of the roaming phenomenon in the context of the Chesnavich model Hamiltonian. The associated potential function, possessing many features associated with a realistic molecular PES, leads to dynamics which clearly reveal the origins of the roaming effect.

284,284,"The expression for Pc is also easily found in the same basis, where it becomes apparent that the dynamics of conversion in matter depends only on the relative orientation of the eigenstates of the vacuum and matter Hamiltonians. This allows to directly apply the known analytical solutions for Pc, and, upon rotating back, obtain a generalization of these results to the NSI case. For example, the answer for the infinite exponential profile [18,19] A∝exp(−r/r0) becomes Pc=exp[γ(1−cos2θrel)/2]−1exp(γ)−1, where γ≡4πr0Δ=πr0Δm2/Eν. We further observe that since γ⪢1 the adiabaticity violation occurs only when |θ−α|⪡1 and φ≃π/2, which is the analogue of the small-angle MSW [10,20] effect in the rotated basis. The “resonant” region in the Sun where level jumping can take place is narrow, defined by A≃Δ [21]. A neutrino produced at a lower density evolves adiabatically, while a neutrino produced at a higher density may undergo level crossing. The probability Pc in the latter case is given to a very good accuracy by the formula for the linear profile, with an appropriate gradient taken along the neutrino trajectory, (12)Pc≃Θ(A−Δ)e−γ(cos2θrel+1)/2, where Θ(x) is the step function, Θ(x)=1 for x>0 and Θ(x)=0 otherwise. We emphasize that our results differ from the similar ones given in [5,22] in three important respects: (i) they are valid for all, not just small values of α (which is essential for our application), (ii) they include the angle φ, and (iii) the argument of the Θ function does not contain cos2θ, as follows from [21]. We stress that for large values of α and φ≃π/2 adiabaticity is violated for large values of θ.

285,285,"As already discussed, in dilute flows the choice between the hard sphere and soft sphere models largely depends on the computational time spent to solve the particle equation of motion. For very dilute flows, the hard sphere model is the most natural choice. However, when the collisions can no longer be assumed as binary and instantaneous, the soft sphere model is the only realistic option. It is interesting to know whether the choice of the collision model affects the statistics. Fig. 14 compares the mean velocity obtained from both models with the experimental data. The same comparison is performed for the smooth walls. The differences between the hard and soft sphere models for the smooth walls are almost negligible. However, the differences between the hard and soft sphere models for the rough walls are minor. This is because the rough wall treatment in the soft sphere implementation adds extra virtual walls during the collision of a particle with a wall, which is a more realistic representation of a rough wall compared to the hard sphere rough wall treatment where one random wall is considered. This is because, a soft sphere collision is not instantaneous and occurs over a finite amount of time. Similarly, the same effects are observed on the fluid statistics. However, Fig. 15, which compares the particle velocity fluctuations, shows that the differences are somewhat larger. Additionally, the differences in both particle mean and RMS velocity profiles are because the hard sphere collisions are unfortunately heavily dependent on the tangential coefficient of restitution (ψ); the effects by varying this quantity are shown in Figs. 16 and 17.

289,289,"Assuming a constant cell electrical conversion efficiency of 15%, a constant fraction of the incident solar radiation would be dissipated by the solar cell for each solar radiation intensity level. From Table 2, it can be seen that for the worst scenario when the ambient temperature was 50°C with natural convection only, the predicted cell electrical conversion efficiency would have reduced to approximately 8% rather than the 15% assumed. The energy dissipated as heat from the cell would thus be 7% higher. To correct for this effect the apparent insolation level should be modified using the following formula:(3)Iact=I×0.850.85+dηwhere Iact is the actual incident solar radiation intensity, dη is solar cell efficiency difference between the initially assumed 15% and final calculated cell efficiency based on measured cell temperature.

290,290,"In the NJL model studied here, we find no stable stars with either CFL or normal quark matter cores. This is the opposite of the prediction of Ref. [15] where it was argued that there is no 2SC phase in compact stars. Let us be more precise: performing a Taylor expansion in the strange quark mass, the authors of Ref. [15] found that in beta-equilibrated electrically and color neutral quark matter the 2SC phase is always less favored than the CFL phase or normal quark matter. From this observation they concluded that the 2SC phase is absent in compact stars. In contrast to this result, it was shown in Ref. [16] in the framework of the NJL model that neutral 2SC matter could be the most favored quark phase in a certain regime. However, the authors argued that this interval might disappear if the hadronic phase is included more properly. This is indeed what we found for parameter set RKH, while for parameter set HK the 2SC phase survives only in a tiny window. Nevertheless, if Nature chooses to be similar to this equation of state, it will be this tiny window which gives rise to hybrid stars, whereas the CFL phase would be never present in compact stars.

Ye et al. investigated the effect of processing of cryomilled Al 5083 powder via SPS [13]. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) grain size calculations before and after SPS showed that the average grain size of the alloy only increased from 25nm to 50nm (from powder to bulk state). Subsequently, the hardness values obtained through nanoindentation for specimens of AA5083 produced via SPS were highly improved in comparison to conventional sintering methods were grain coarsening takes place on a larger scale. In another study the combination of cryomilling and SPS of AA-5356/B4C nanocomposites powder was found to largely improve the microhardness and flexural strengths of the bulk nanocomposite. Rana et al. [14] investigated the effect of SPS on mechanically milled AA6061 (Al–Mg–Si) micro-alloy powder. The average grain size after 20h of milling was ∼35nm and increased to only ∼85nm after processing with SPS at 500°C. Microhardness and compressive tests were carried out on the consolidated near full density specimens of both unmilled and milled powders and the results showed significant increase in both hardness and compressive strengths for the milled nanocrystalline powders as a result of the very fine grain size.

292,292,"Although mean-field models have been used in all these settings, little analysis has been done on their behaviour as spatially extended dynamical systems. In part, this is due to their staggering complexity. The Liley model [15] considered here, for instance, consists of fourteen coupled Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with strong nonlinearities, imposed by coupling between the mean membrane potentials and the mean synaptic inputs. The model can be reduced to a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) by considering only spatially homogeneous solutions, and the resulting system has been examined in detail using numerical bifurcation analysis (see [16] and references therein). In order to compute equilibria, periodic orbits and such objects for the PDE model, we need a flexible, stable simulation code for the model and its linearization that can run in parallel to scale up to a domain size of about 2500cm2, the size of a full-grown human cortex. We also need efficient, iterative solvers for linear problems with large, sparse matrices. In this paper, we will show that all this can be accomplished in the open-source software package PETSc [17].

294,294,"The primary benefit of using a 3D model is that it allows the application of anisotropic material properties. As a hexagonal close packed lattice structure, a single zirconium grain is plastically anisotropic due to the difficulty of activating slip with a 〈c〉 component [23–26]. Abaqus allows this to be represented by setting plasticity potential ratios. The anisotropic elastic and plastic constants are shown in Table 1. Zirconium alloys can often have a bimodal basal pole distribution, with a tilt on the basal normal or c direction of ±30° in the normal direction being quoted for recrystallized Zircaloy-4 [27,28]. However, for simplicity the basal normal or c direction has been taken as being parallel to the normal direction. As such the 1, 2 and 3 directions in Table 1 correlate with the X, Y and Z global coordinate system for the 3D simulations, with the 3 direction correlating to the c direction of a zirconium unit lattice. Table 1 also shows the elastic properties incorporated into the simulations. The oxide layer has been simulated as a purely elastic material. Although it is known that the oxide is strongly textured [29], it is still simulated as a homogenous solid therefore isotropic material properties have been used for the oxide in all simulations.

We hope to carry out a detail study on this issue in the future. Furthermore, in the context of brane world cosmology, it was found that a brane moving in a Reissner–Nordström AdS background generates non-singular cosmology [14]. However, as shown in [15], the brane always crosses the inner horizon of the bulk geometry, creating an instability. It would be interesting to study cosmology on the brane when it is moving in the charged black hole backgrounds that we have constructed. Note that since these charged holes does not have inner horizon for certain range of parameters, we may generate non-singular cosmology without creating the instabilities that we have just mentioned.

300,300,"The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) is a well-developed perturbation theory used to describe quantitatively the volumetric properties of fluids. The reader is referred to several reviews on the topic which describe the various stages of its development and the multiple versions available [50–53]. The fundamental difference between the versions is in the underlying intermolecular potential employed to describe the unbounded constituent particles. Hard spheres, square well fluids, LJ fluids, argon, alkanes have all been employed as reference fluids in the different incarnations of SAFT. For the purpose of this work we will center on a particular version of the SAFT EoS, i.e. the SAFT-VR Mie recently proposed by Laffitte et al. [54] and expanded into a group contribution approach, SAFT-γ, by Papaioannou et al. [55]. This particular version of SAFT provides a closed form EoS that describes the macroscopical properties of the Mie potential [56], also known as the (m,n) potential; a generalized form of the LJ potential (albeit predating it by decades). The Mie potential has the form(1)ϕ(r)=Cεσrλr−σrλawhere C is an analytical function of the repulsive and attractive exponents, λa and λr, respectively, σ is a parameter that defines the length scale and is loosely related to the average diameter of a Mie bead; ɛ defines the energy scale and corresponds to the minimum potential energy between two isolated beads; expressed here as a ratio to the Boltzmann constant, kB. The Mie function, as written above, deceivingly suggests that four parameters are needed to characterize the behaviour of an isotropic molecule, however the exponents λa and λr are intimately related, and for fluid phase equilibria, one needs not consider them as independent parameters [57]. Accordingly, we choose herein to fix the attractive exponent to λa=6 which would be expected to be representative of the dispersion scaling of most simple fluids and refer from here on to the repulsive parameter as λ=λr. The potential simplifies to(2)ϕ(r)=λλ−6λ66/(λ−6)εσrλ−σr6

However, this technology is still far from being able to compete with fossil fuel-based energy conversion technologies because of its relatively low efficiency and energy density. Theoretically, there are three unavoidable losses that limit the solar conversion efficiency of a device with a single absorption threshold or band gap Eg: (1) incomplete absorption, where photons with energies below Eg are not absorbed; (2) thermalization or carrier cooling, where solar photons with sufficient energy generate electron-hole pairs and then immediately lose almost all energy in excess of Eg in the form of heat; and (3) radiative recombination, where a small fraction of the excited states radioactively recombine with the ground state at the maximum power output (Hanna & Nozik, 2006; Henry, 1980). Taking an air mass of 1.5 as an example, for different band gap Eg these three losses can be calculated and the results are indicated by areas S1, S2, and S3 in Fig. 1.

One of the imidazolium salt’s most promising attributes is its antimicrobial action [12,18] and molecular self-assembly into liquid crystals [19,20]. 1-Alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides and bromides, 1-alkyl-2-methyl-3-hydroxyethylimidazolium chlorides, and N-alkyl-N-hydroxyethylpyrrolidinonium, for example, all exhibit strong biocidal activity [18]. Hydrogels form from polymerized methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids with acryloyl groups; the polymer self-assembles into organized lamellae with unique swelling properties, leading to bioactive applications [19]. Other bioactive applications for imidazolium salts include antiarrhythmics [21], anti-metastic agents [22,23], and imidazolium-based steroids [24]. Separation applications include efficient absorption of CO2 [25]. Imidazolium salts enhance vesicle formation as imidazolium surfactants [26], and they also find application in polymeric actuators [27].

307,307,"The threshold values for removing large caters were determined by examining the craters within the study area, referencing previous studies (Molloy and Stepinski, 2007), and some trial and error. After the parameter values are determined, the rest of the process is automated. However, we do anticipate some minimum manual editing may be needed in some complicated terrains when apply it to all of Mars. To minimize the distortion resulted from map projection on global datasets, we will choose an equal area projection by evaluating the options suggested in Steinwand et al. (1995) or conduct geodesic area calculation using software such as “Tools for Graphics and Shapes” (http://www.jennessent.com/arcgis/shapes_graphics.htm)Although post-formational modification to the valleys may be minimum (Williams and Phillips, 2001), there may nonetheless be modifications such as eolian fill and mass wasting (e.g., Grant et al., 2008). Thus the volume estimates derived with PBTH method represents a lower bound. Comparing the estimates from MOLA and HRSC data reveals that MOLA estimate is about 91% of HRSC value. However, MOLA has global coverage whereas HRSC does not. Therefore, for areas where there is only MOLA coverage, the estimate may be scaled upward by 1.1 times. The algorithm has been tested on DEMs with various resolutions (2 m for simulated DEM, 75m for HRSC, and 463m for MOLA). It can certainly be applied to higher resolution DEMs for Mars when they become available, but the threshold values will need to be adjusted.

308,308,"From this study where a commercial Al–12Si alloy was inoculated with different level of Nb+B addition to assess the grain refining potency of Nb+B inoculation it can be concluded that in-situ formed Nb-based intermetallics compounds are potent heterogeneous nucleation substrates with high potency for the refinement of Al–Si cast alloys. The primary α-Al dendritic grain size varies with the addition level of Nb and B. Moreover, significant grain refinement over a wide range of cooling rates is obtained via enhanced heterogeneous nucleation making the grain size of the material less sensitive to the cooling rate. Nb+B inoculants are characterised by some fading which is still acceptable after 4 h of contact time. Moreover, alloys refined by means of Nb+B inoculants can be recycled obtaining a fine grain structure with small addition or no further addition of inoculants after the first initial addition. Concluding, Nb+B inoculation is a promising candidate for the refinement of cast Al alloy which could lead to their wider employment in the automotive industry with the resultant intrinsic advantages of lighter structural component from an environmental point of view.

310,310,"The optical properties of charged excitations are important for understanding organic semiconductor photophysics. The injection of electric charge into organic materials polarizes the surroundings and changes the bond lengths around it, such an excitation is defined as a charged polaron. Absorption of light and fluorescence quenching by polarons are important issues in the operation of organic optoelectronic devices. It is particularly relevant to the development of electrically pumped lasers. With recent advances in materials properties and optical design the lasing threshold of organic structures under optical pumping is now low enough to enable pumping by inorganic laser diodes [1–3] and LEDs [4] which is promising for fabrication of very sensitive low-cost devices for biosensing and chemosensing [5,6]. However, light absorption by injected charges has been reported to be the major obstacle to electrically pumped lasing [7]. Injected charges can also quench luminescence as they accept energy from excitons by resonant dipole–dipole interactions and this is an important loss mechanism in organic LEDs as well as in lasers. Absorption cross-sections of polarons are not known to the desired accuracy because of the difficulty of quantifying the charge density injected into the film. Previous studies used controlled electrical injection of charges in unipolar devices through contacting electrodes and field-dependent charge mobility measurements to estimate the charge densities which were compared with the values obtained by capacitance–voltage analysis and the two results differed by a factor of three [8,9].

There are many examples of this throughout the literature, both in terms of the more traditionally utilised continuous Galerkin (CG) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulations, as well as newer extensions such as the flux reconstruction (FR) technique as presented by Huynh [23]. In collocation methods, while most linear operators can be exactly integrated in this setting depending on the choice of quadrature, integrals of nonlinear terms typically incur numerical error.

313,313,"Since the receptors in human biology mostly consist of chiral molecules, drug action mostly involves a specified enantiomeric form. This has spurred the development, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, of a host of techniques to secure enantiopure products. Such methods, mostly multi-step and time-consuming, can typically be cast in one of two distinct categories: synthetic mechanisms designed to produce a single stereoisomer, or separation techniques to isolate distinct enantiomers from a racemic mixture. A significant drawback, for either approach, is a dependence on a supply of enantiopure reagents or substrates – synthesis routes generally utilise chiral building blocks or enantioselective catalysts [7,8], while enantiomer separation techniques typically incorporate chiral selector molecules to form chemically distinct and distinguishable diastereomeric complexes [8,9]. A key requirement in aiming to achieve enantiopure products, irrespective of the synthetic method, is therefore a means to measure, and duly quantitate the enantiomeric excess – signifying the degree of chirality within molecular products. Chiral discrimination through optical means is well-known to offer direct, non-contact ways to distinguish between molecules of different handedness, based on observations such as the subtle differences in absorption of left- and right-handed circularly polarised light, or indeed the twisting of polarisation in optical rotation. Other optical methods, under more recent development, also show some promise to achieve enantiomer separation, as will be introduced later.

However, research is focused primarily on the effect of the data loss during the communication and how to mitigate it [34]. In the thermo-electric co-simulation example in [35], the time constant is larger in the thermal simulation than that of power system simulation. Thus the communication latency will not significantly affect the accuracy of co-simulation. In [36], the co-simulation is performed using resources at the same location without synthetically introduced delays, which means the communication latency between RT simulators is ignored. In [37], the authors have mentioned the communication latency as an important factor in the distributed simulation and that its effect on simulation stability will be studied as future work.

In two dimensions this is simple as the boundary may be parametrised along its arc-length and the associated momentum (or direction) coordinate taken tangential to the boundary. The basis can be any suitable (scaled) univariate basis in both position and momentum, such as a Fourier basis [8] or Chebyshev polynomials [9].

317,317,"Plastically deformed MGs develop inhomogeneity and show harder and softer regions [16]. While this could in principle be associated with a BE according to the composite model, a MG provides no basis for a dislocation-based theory. The search for a BE in plastic flow is hindered by the softening of MGs associated with shear-banding (in contrast to the work-hardening familiar in conventional alloys). Anelastic deformation is, however, of interest as its time-dependence must relate to relaxation processes in the MG structure that in turn should be connected to the onset of plasticity. In particular, anelasticity may offer a way to study the operation of the shear transformation zones (STZs [17]) often used to interpret the deformation of MGs. Fujita et al. have used torsion tests to observe anelasticity in MGs loaded (at maximum, on the cylindrical sample surface) to 30%, 16% and just 4% of the shear yield stress τy [18]. In the present work we apply torsion to MG samples to reach stresses up to 24% of τy, and for the first time in the elastic regime investigate the effects of torque reversal.

318,318,"Two-state models are often insufficient to fit complex traces, therefore we also study the approximate fitting of large M3PPs. In the single class setting, a known limitation of MMPPs is the inability to simultaneously fit many statistical descriptors due to the non-linearity of their underlying equations (Bodrog, Heindl, Horváth, & Telek, 2008; Heindl, Horváth, & Gross, 2006; Horváth & Telek, 2009). This has led to the definition of several approaches to fit complex traces by composing multiple small-sized MMPPs or MAPs using Kronecker operators (Andersen & Nielsen, 1998; Casale, Zhang, & Smirni, 2010; Horváth & Telek, 2002). These methods employ composition operators for moment fitting, offering a different trade-off between computational cost and fitting accuracy compared to fitting methods based on the EM algorithm (Breuer, 2002; Horváth & Okamura, 2013; Klemm, Lindemann, & Lohmann, 2003). In particular, the superposition operator allows one to describe a trace by the statistical multiplexing of several MMPPs, at the expense of an exponential growth of the number of states in the resulting process (Sriram & Whitt, 1986). This state space explosion is an obstacle for the application of MMPPs and MAPs to modeling real systems; for example it considerably slows down, or even renders infeasible, the numerical evaluation of queueing models by matrix geometric methods (Bini, Meini, Steffé, Pérez, & Houdt, 2012; Pérez, Velthoven, & Houdt, 2008).

319,319,"Contact methods have been developed and used in Lagrangian staggered-grid hydrodynamic (SGH) calculations for many years. Early examples of contact methods are discussed in Wilkins [37] and Cherry et al. [7]. Hallquist et al. [17] provides an overview of multiple contact algorithms used in various Lagrangian SGH codes dating back to HEMP [37]. Of particular interest, Hallquist et al. [17] describes the contact surface scheme used in TOODY [31] and later implemented in DYNA2D [36]. The contact method of TOODY uses a master–slave approach. The goal of this approach is to treat the nodes on the contact surface in a manner similar to an internal node. The physical properties of the slave surface are interpolated to a ghost mesh (termed phony elements in [17]) that overlays the slave zones. The physical properties are interpolated from the slave surface to the ghost zones using surface area weights. The surface area weights are equal to the ratio of the ghost zone surface area to the surface area of the master surface. The contact surface method for nodal-based Lagrangian cell-centered hydrodynamics (CCH) presented in this paper will use surface area weights similar in concept to those in TOODY. Following the area fraction approach of TOODY may seem retrospective; however, using surface area weights naturally extends to the new CCH methods that solve a Riemann-like problem at the node of a zone [10,24,25,3].

321,321,"One way to enforce this ratio is to use a probabilistic, ‘roulette wheel’ style lane selection policy. VISSIM, along with most simulation toolkits, offers methods to specify probabilistic routing whereby a defined percentage of vehicles are sent down unique routes. This is a piecewise technique that can be reapplied at various locations around a simulation. While these methods are attractive from a calibration perspective as exact representations of existing statistics can be ensured, the process is an unrealistic one as it assumes that drivers make probabilistic decisions at precise locations. So in this case when a vehicle arrives at a point prior to the weighbridges it is allocated one of the lanes based on the respective probabilities. It turns out that this method leads to significant variations in trip times depending on the initial random number seed, this can be seen in a graphic of the key areas of the simulation for the 2 different runs (Fig. 7). One of the benefits of graphical microsimulation is that the 2D and 3D simulations help the researcher to visualise a new scheme and its potential benefits but also to highlight unrealistic behaviour. Fig. 7 shows the congestion at the decision point for 2 different runs. Using probabilistic routing to enforce correct routing percentages is a clear case of overcalibration affecting simulation brittleness.

323,323,"In this work, a numerical strategy for designing an optimal maintenance scheduling for a structure, accounting explicitly for the effects of uncertainty is suggested. This contribution, which can be regarded as an extension of the methods developed in [23], presents several novel aspects over similar approaches proposed in the literature. Firstly, the initiation and propagation of fatigue crack is modeled efficiently by means of cohesive zone elements [24–26]. The application of this class of elements allows modeling the crack initiation and propagation within a unified framework. It should be noted that cohesive zone elements have already been used for uncertainty quantification of the crack propagation phenomenon [27,28]. However its application within the context of maintenance scheduling constitutes a novelty. The second innovative aspect of this contribution refers to the assessment of the reliability sensitivity with respect to the variables that define the maintenance scheduling. The estimation of this sensitivity, which is required in order to determine the optimal maintenance schedule within the proposed framework, can be quite demanding as the model characterizing repair of a cracked structure leads to a discontinuous performance function associated with the failure probability. A new approach for modeling this function is proposed herein. The continuous and discontinuous parts respectively of the function are considered separately to estimate accurately the gradients of the failure events.

324,324,"Inequality (22) indicates that the maximum-norm is the loosest among all p-norms. Fortunately, this loosest constraint would not seriously affect the accuracy since the value of ||y||∞ is comparable to that of the 2-norm and 1-norm. The maximum-norm provides us with the largest number of possible solutions under a given error limitation [24]. This would greatly enhance the possibility of finding a group of optimized coefficients when scanning a vast solution set. On the other hand, checking the maximum deviation sounds more reasonable than checking the “distance” between the accurate and approximated wave numbers since it is not working in the space domain. Therefore, we chose the maximum-norm as our criterion for designing the objective functions to extend the accurate wave number coverage as widely as possible.

325,325,"One of the most important outcomes of the comparative analysis is the fact that in all tested cases the use of FM is associated with a dramatic reduction in computational time when compared with FE, generally being in the order of seconds for FM and in the order of hours for FE. Table 1 reports the timings of the simulations for both methods. Free expansion is the fastest case, where FM reaches the load-free configuration in just 2 s, while simulations inside the vessels with the diameter of around 30 mm take approximately 30 s. Most of the execution time of the FM deployment algorithm is dedicated to the contact check and calculations of the implications the vessel wall has on the stent structure. Interestingly, in both methods, the highest computational time (i.e., curved vessels) is not associated with the most complex geometry (i.e., patient-specific case of aortic dissection). Another fact worth mentioning is the relation of the computational time to the diameter of the vessel in both methods. While the computational time of FM appeared to be directly related to the diameter of the vessel, no immediate relation was found for the FE simulations. Such outcome is probably related to the simplified contact model used by FM, which makes the stent-graft expansion terminate once the nodes come in contact with the vessel wall. On the contrary, it is well known that the contact algorithm used in the FE analyses increases the computational cost of the simulations.

326,326,"Thus, the extension to the charmed analogue Θc(3099) provides an interesting test for the SDO sum rule and lattice calculations [17]. Here, the charm quark is quite heavy so that the constituent-quark picture may fit well and the JW prediction for the parity is expected to be reproduced from QCD. In fact, quenched lattice calculation finds the parity of Θc(3099) to be positive [28]. In the extension to the Θc(3099) sum rules, there are two important aspects, which make this sum rule different from the SDO sum rule. First of all, since the charm quark is too heavy to form quark condensate, it gives non-perturbative effects only by radiating gluons. The quark–gluon mixed condensate 〈s̄gsσ·Gs〉, which was the important contribution in the Θ+ sum rule, is replaced by gluonic operators in the heavy quark expansion that are normally suppressed. Secondly, the charm quark mass has to be kept finite in the OPE, which can be done by using the momentum space expression for the charm-quark propagator. This is different from the light-quark sum rule where the calculation is performed in the coordinate space and all the quark propagators are obtained based on the expansion with the small quark mass. Keeping these two aspects in mind, we construct QCD sum rules for Θc(3099) and see how they are different from the Θ+(1540) sum rule.

The ferromagnetic characteristics as coercivity, remanence and magnetic anisotropy of the nanocomposite can be adjusted by the electrochemical parameters. Furthermore the spatial distribution of the metal structures within the pores can be varied which means that the magnetic interactions between the particles can be influenced. In the case of densely packed particles within the pores dipolar coupling between them occurs and results in quasi magnetic chains which offer a much larger magnetic anisotropy than non-interacting particles. By modifying the current density small Ni-particles (3–6nm) can be deposited. If the packing density of these particles is sufficiently close, Ni-tubes of a few nanometer in thickness are covering the pore walls.

329,329,"Zirconium alloys are used as cladding to encapsulate fuel pellets in pressurised and boiling water nuclear reactors. Research into oxidation of these alloys has been significant since the introduction of the material. However, the microstructure and electro-chemical processes during oxidation are complex and many questions still remain unanswered. One such issue is the formation of lateral cracks near the metal-oxide interface. Small cracks have been seen to form continuously during oxidation, with large scale networks of lateral cracks forming cyclically every ∼2μm of oxide growth. These networks of cracks can be correlated with acceleration in the corrosion kinetics [1–7]. These lateral cracks might enable the link up of nano pores along grain boundaries perpendicular to the metal/oxide interface as reported in [8,9]. Experiments using Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction (S-XRD) by both Polatidis et al. and Petigny et al., have separately shown that oxides formed on Zircaloy-4 are composed of monoclinic and stabilised tetragonal phases, with an ∼7% reduction in the tetragonal phase fraction from 1 to 3μm oxide growth [4,10]. One theory is that the lateral cracks may destabilise the tetragonal phase close to the metal-oxide interface. The phase transformation has an ∼6% expansion associated with it, which could lead to fracture perpendicular to the metal-oxide interface, thereby generating fast ingress routes for oxygen containing species [11,12].

Each library could then be heat-treated at a different temperature and an initial powder XRD screen was used to locate and approximate phase boundary. A more focussed second synthesis and XRD characterisation of selected larger heat-treated powders was then performed to reconfirm the locations of the phase boundaries with the highest dopant level being achieved for La4Ni2FeO10 which is significantly greater Fe doping than has been achieved by anyone previously (despite several notable efforts).

333,333,"Volume EM can be performed using transmission or scanning electron microscopes. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice is dependant on the required lateral (x, y) and axial (z) resolution, and the size of the structure of interest. Historically, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was the tool of choice for ultrastructural examination of biomedical specimens at sub-nanometer resolution. However, for many cell biology studies structural resolution is actually limited by the deposition of heavy metals onto membranes during sample preparation. In addition, voxel dimensions may only need to be half that of the smallest expected feature of interest (Briggman and Bock, 2012). Advances in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technology are now driving a paradigm shift in electron imaging. SEMs with field emission electron sources and high efficiency electron detectors can achieve lateral resolutions in the order of 3nm, allowing visualisation of structures such as synaptic vesicles and membranes (De Winter et al., 2009; Knott et al., 2008; Vihinen et al., 2013; Villinger et al., 2012), though resolving individual leaflets of membrane bilayers remains a challenge (Vihinen et al., 2013). The use of low beam energies also limits the interaction volume, enhancing axial resolution (Hennig and Denk, 2007). In this review, volume imaging in both transmission and scanning EMs will be explored, moving from traditional manual techniques, through to the latest systems where aspects of both sample preparation and imaging have been automated.

334,334,"We consider the shape optimisation of two- and three-dimensional solids by combining multiresolution subdivision surfaces with immersed finite elements. As widely discussed in isogeometric analysis literature, the geometry representations used in today’s computer aided design (CAD) and finite element analysis (FEA) software are inherently incompatible  [1]. This is particularly limiting in shape optimisation during which a given CAD geometry model is to be iteratively updated based on the results of a finite element computation. The inherent shortcomings of present geometry and analysis representations have motivated the proliferation of various shape optimisation techniques. In the most prevalent approaches a surrogate geometry model  [2–8] or the analysis mesh  [9,10] instead of the true CAD model is optimised, see also  [11] and references therein. Generally, it is tedious or impossible to map the optimised surrogate geometry model or analysis mesh back to the original CAD model, which is essential for continuing with the design process and later for manufacturing purposes.

335,335,"This conclusion is a consequence of the high jet speeds and small nozzle diameters in combination with the relatively high viscosity solvent and modest molecular weights of the polystyrene, which results in high Weissenberg numbers and moderate values of the extensibility, L studied here. As discussed in earlier papers [3,6], other jetting fluid combinations, such as those of de Gans et al. [4], lie in a different jetting regime where full extension does not occur and relaxation time controls the viscoelastic behaviour. Consequently inkjet fluid assessment methods need to provide a full characterisation including both linear and nonlinear viscoelastic properties. This complexity suggests assessments of inkjet fluids might have to include jetting from sets of DoD print head devices with different sensitivities to all the various VE parameters [37], rather than reliance on testing without jetting. This was not the expected outcome from the present work but does echo the very pragmatic viewpoint expressed as a “map of misery” by Clasen et al. [38] and may provide a way forward for future R&D strategies towards ink testing.

336,336,"One of the challenges in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the relativistic bound state problem. In the light-cone Hamiltonian approach [1] light-cone wave functions can be constructed in a boost invariant way. It is necessary to have reliable light-cone wave functions if one wants to calculate high energy scattering, especially exclusive reactions. Many parametrizations assume separability of the dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction and transverse momentum which is very unlikely since the two momenta are coupled in the kinetic energy operator. Various approaches have been tried to compute such wave functions. One can use the usual equal time Hamiltonian [2] and transform the resulting wave functions into light-cone form with the help of kinematical on-shell equations. The light-cone Hamiltonian in a string picture is formulated in Ref. [3]. More ambitious is the construction of an effective Hamiltonian including the gauge degrees of freedom explicitly and then solving the bound state problem. For mesons this approach [4,5] still needs many parameters to be fixed. Attempts have been made to solve the valence quark wave function for mesons in a simple Hamiltonian with a two-body potential [6].

337,337,"When we formulate the downscaling problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, we face, however, the following problems. Minimizing the sum of different objectives is problematic, since they may have different units and ranges. Even with an appropriate scaling procedure there is a risk of treating the objectives unequally or getting trapped in a local minimum. Firstly, we can never know, what is the minimum value of each objective that can be achieved by the regression. Thus, designing an appropriate scaling procedure is difficult and one would need to decide on the relative importance of the different objectives in advance. Secondly, adding multiple, conflicting objectives very likely results in a fitness function with multiple local minima, which makes optimization more difficult. To avoid these problems, we have implemented fitness calculation according to the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) by Zitzler and Thiele (1999), instead of using a single (weighted) fitness or cost function. Approaches for multi-objective optimization like SPEA are widely used in evolutionary computation. In SPEA the fitness calculation during the fitting procedure is based on an intercomparison of the different models. Further, a finite set of so called Pareto optimal models (downscaling rules) is returned.

339,339,"In previous publications the present authors proposed a method to incorporate the thermodynamics of ternary alloys and liquid diffusion-governed solidification kinetics into a multiphase volume average solidification model [23,24]. Back diffusion was disregarded. A way to access the thermodynamic data (e.g. Thermo-Calc [1]) through a tabulation and interpolation program ISAT (In Situ Adaptive Tabulation) was suggested. With the ISAT approach it is possible to perform an online call of the thermodynamic data and trace the formation of each individual solid phase (primary, peritectic, eutectic, etc.). As the number of calls of the thermodynamic data is equal to the product of the number of the discretized volume elements, the time steps and the calculation iterations per time step, the calculation becomes exhausting. Therefore, the current model is a modification of the previous model using a linearized phase diagram, and no online call of thermodynamic data is necessary. In addition, the model presented in this paper is extended to consider the back diffusion into the solid. With these modifications, the model can be used to perform casting process simulations with incorporated full diffusion-governed solidification kinetics for ternary alloys at a reasonable computation cost.

340,340,"It is critical to the success of the NPD technique that the MOF complex adsorbs a significant amount of D2 to boost the observed signal. This technique therefore has disadvantages when studying the binding interaction within MOFs with low uptakes. Furthermore, static crystallographic studies cannot provide insights into the dynamics of the adsorbed gas molecules. Thus, it is very challenging to probe experimentally the H2 binding interactions within a porous host system which has very low gas uptake due to the lack of suitable characterisation techniques. We report herein the application of the in situ inelastic neutron scattering (INS) technique to permit direct observation of the dynamics of the binding interactions between adsorbed H2 molecules and an aluminium-based porous MOF, NOTT-300, exhibiting moderate porosity, narrow pore window and very low uptake of H2. This neutron spectroscopy study reveals that adsorbed H2 molecules do not interact with the organic ligand within the pore channels, and form very weak interactions with [Al(OH)2O4] moieties via a type of through-spacing interaction (Al-O⋯H2). Interestingly, the very low H2 adsorption has been successfully characterised as weak binding interactions and, for the first time, we have found that the adsorbed H2 in the pore channel has a liquid type recoil motion at 5K (below its melting point) as a direct result of this weak interaction to the MOF host.

342,342,"Methods for anomaly detection in a local context are the conceptual opposite to the afore-described centralized methods, which rely on globally shared models. In data mining, the notion of locality is often given as distance between data values (given a specific distance metric such as Euclidean distance). A data point is compared to the value of its nearest neighbors in terms of data distance [42]. However, the notion of locality can also be given in a geographical distance between the sources of the data. Many similar values (i.e., data with small distance among each other) result in a higher density, called clusters, while values that are less similar result in a lower density. Anomalies can fall outside of any cluster but, when frequently occurring, can form a cluster too. Determining if a datum is normal or anomalous compared to local neighborhood data is a challenge.

We believe that the implications of this observation have not been clearly emphasised in the literature, as attested by the absence of any debate about it in recent works. It is precisely these dangerous infrared modes that make it hard to define a gauge independent renormalisation for the gauge invariant extensions of local functionals. This observation supports the remark in [2] that the expectation value receives important contributions from both large and small distances.

344,344,"In general, liquid film flows of practical relevance are turbulent and, hence, are associated with the presence of broadband interfacial waves on the film surface. A thorough understanding of the characteristic profiles, scales and dynamics of these interfacial waves is of essential importance in making accurate and reliable predictions of heat and mass transfer rates (Mathie and Markides, 2013a; Mathie et al., 2013). Previous efforts in downwards annular flow have focused on the spatio/temporal measurement of liquid film thickness, followed by in-depth statistical analyses of this film thickness (Webb and Hewitt, 1975; Belt et al., 2010; Alekseenko et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2013). These efforts have contributed to a much improved understanding of the interfacial topology observed in downwards annular flows and also to the subsequent proposal of a series of correlations for the quantification of the mean film thickness, wave amplitudes and liquid entrainment rates into the gas phase (Ambrosini et al., 1991; Karapantsios and Karabelas, 1995; Azzopardi, 1997). On the other hand, less has been published on the velocity distribution and the flow structure within the liquid films, underneath the film surface. This can be related to the relative difficulty of these measurements caused by: (i) the extremely restricted measurement space, due to the small thickness of the liquid films (in the order of and often sub-mm), (ii) the highly disturbed and intermittent nature of the gas–liquid interface, (iii) the entrainment of gas inside the liquid film and of liquid into the gas core, and (iv) the relatively high velocities of both the gas and liquid phases.

347,347,"In general, the ion exchange capacity (IEC) is closely related to the proton conductivity of PEMs because the acid functionalities, such as sulfonic acid groups, contribute to the proton conduction in a membrane. Beyond a certain sulfonation degree, PEMs tend to absorb too much water or are even soluble in water, which negatively affect their mechanical resistance and water resistance [17,18]. Therefore, the improvement of proton conductivity using aromatic polymers with moderately adjusted IEC values has been under intense investigation [19–23]. To achieve high proton conductivity with moderate IEC values, the formation of ion channel structures, which enable effective proton conduction, has been studied. In the course of these studies, an ideal morphology has been pursued by microphase separation of segmented block copolymers in which hydrophilic sulfonated polymer segments form an interconnected three-dimensional network responsible for efficient proton transport, while a complementary network of hydrophobic non-sulfonated segments imparts a reinforcing effect, preventing excessive swelling in water and enhancing the mechanical properties.

Frankel presented a method to directly measure the average anodic current density from the growing pit boundary velocity in Al [33], an Al alloy [34] and Ni–Fe [35] thin films. Subsequently, Ryan et al. [27,36] determined the anodic current density in pits propagating as 2D disks in stainless steel thin films by measuring the pit edge movement velocity. Ernst and Newman [11,12,37] studied stability of pit growth in detail and measured the kinetics of 2D pit propagation in depth and width and compared the results with kinetics in 1D pencil electrodes. They developed a semi-quantitative model for pit propagation which explained the lacy pit cover formation during the pit growth, although they did not measure current density within the pit. More recently, Tang and Davenport [38] tracked the pit boundary movement and computed the instantaneous but average current density in Fe-Co thin films.

The second objective of this work was to determine the parameters of a crystal plasticity constitutive model to describe the cyclic deformation behaviour of the material by using a user-defined material subroutine (UMAT) interfaced with the finite element package ABAQUS.

Increased degree of freedom in scans of time delays allows one to separate and extract specific type of spectroscopic information in complex molecules by studying spectral and temporal evolution of the photon echo signals. By varying the population times, population relaxation dynamics and inhomogeneous broadening is revealed in the photon echo spectra. Time-integrated photon echo signals show two different timescales. The electronic relaxation timescale is found to be sub 50fs whereas the timescale for intramolecular vibrational relaxation, occurring in Q00 band, was found to be over a picosecond for Co(II)–OEP and Ni(II)–OEP and within a picosecond for Zn(II)–OEP.

357,357,"These results demonstrate that SW-SVR predicts complicated micrometeorological data with the best prediction performance and the lowest computational complexity compared with standard algorithms. In particular, we found that dynamic aggregation of models built from very little extracted data by D-SDC is effective for compatibility of high prediction performance and low computational complexity. However, there are problems to be solved in SW-SVR. Firstly, the prediction performance of SW-SVR sometimes deteriorates despite an increase of training data. In particular, this problem occurred under the conditions that prediction horizons are 6 h as shown in Fig. 3. This is because data extracted by D-SDC involves unnecessary training data for highly accurate prediction. If D-SDC extracts the same data as the extracted data when training periods are shorter, the prediction performance of SW-SVR never deteriorates due to an increase of training data. Therefore, we must review both feature mapping and algorithms of D-SDC so as to avoid extracting unnecessary training data. Meanwhile, SW-SVR is based on a combination of several algorithms: kernel approximation, PLS regression, k-means, D-SDC, and linear SVR. Moreover, each algorithm has several parameters. Therefore, SW-SVR has more varied parameters, and it takes more time to tune the parameters. In this experiment, we used a grid search roughly so as to decide the parameters in a certain time. However, there is still room for improvement in the prediction performance by using other approaches such as a genetic algorithm instead of a grid search (Huang & Wang, 2006).

Note, as pointed out by [11] world volume solitons have a much sharper potential than the Coulomb type potential typical of brane solutions in supergravity; thus this scattering is different to that of the string in six-dimensional supergravity.

Although these solutions are obtained from semi-classical arguments in weak coupling limit, their validity as quantal states is justified based on the associated topological conservation laws. A more curious occurrence is that of fermionic zero-energy modes trapped on such solutions. Their presence requires, according to well-known arguments [1,2], an assignment of half-integer fermion number to the solitonic states. In the usual treatment, the back reaction of the fermion zero-modes on the soliton itself is ignored. However, the fractional values of the fermionic charge have interesting consequence for the fate of the soliton if the latter is not strictly stable. The reason for this is that if the configuration were to relax to trivial vacuum in isolation, there is no particle-like state available for carrying the fractional value of the fermionic charge. Dynamical stability of such objects was pointed out in [3], in cosmological context in [4,5] and more recently in [6–8].

The difference in pass rates at 88K between batches #3/#4 and #5/#6, which use the same process technology with the same dimensions, can be explained by the fabrication in different assembly lines, where other processes or base materials may have been changed.

Sometimes, parasitic small ferromagnetic particles can be included in these disks that may decrease the mechanical stability. For this reason, in case of a suspicion disks are to be analysed with respect to ferromagnetic inclusions. These inclusions generate a magnetic density which can be measured by a flux gate magnetometer using the magnetic remanence method [1]. The detection principle of ferromagnetic impurities in non-magnetic metallic materials is based on their remanence. Before such a measurement can be carried out, the aeroengine turbine disks are premagnetised in axial direction. As ferromagnetic materials show the well-known hysteresis behaviour, those materials can be magnetised by a strong magnetic field which drives the magnetic material into saturation. When removing the magnetic field, the remanence is left. This remaining flux density is used to detect them in non-magnetic materials.

369,369,"The dashed curve represents the PuO2 molar fraction on the sample surface. It shows that, following the UO2–PuO2 phase boundaries, rather well established in this compositional range (see Section 4.3 below), the newly formed liquid surface is initially enriched in plutonium dioxide. Subsequently, due to fast diffusion in the liquid phase, the initial sample composition (x(PuO2)=0.25) tends to be rapidly restored. It is however clear, from the simulation, that the fast cooling occurring after the end of the laser pulse leads to onset of solidification before the initial composition is fully recovered in the liquid. A surface solid crust forms then upon freezing before the total liquid mass has crystallised (see insets in Fig. 4). The double inflection during cooling in this case corresponds to the solidification onset on the sample surface (first inflection) and to the disappearance of the last liquid inside the material (second inflection). The highest recalescence temperature represents the solidification point of a composition very close to the initial one (approximately ±0.01 on x(PuO2) in the current example), except for small segregation effects. These latter have been studied also experimentally in the present research, by post-melting material characterisation.

371,371,"The reason to investigate the BFKL and DGLAP equations in the case of supersymmetric theories is based on a common belief, that the high symmetry may significantly simplify the structure of these equations. Indeed, it was found in the leading logarithmic approximation (LLA) [10], that the so-called quasi-partonic operators in N=1 SYM are unified in supermultiplets with anomalous dimensions obtained from universal anomalous dimensions γuni(j) by shifting its arguments by an integer number. Further, the anomalous dimension matrices for twist-2 operators are fixed by the superconformal invariance [10]. Calculations in the maximally extended N=4 SYM, where the coupling constant is not renormalized, give even more remarkable results. Namely, it turns out, that here all twist-2 operators enter in the same multiplet, their anomalous dimension matrix is fixed completely by the super-conformal invariance and its universal anomalous dimension in LLA is proportional to Ψ(j−1)−Ψ(1), which means, that the evolution equations for the matrix elements of quasi-partonic operators in the multicolor limit Nc→∞ are equivalent to the Schrödinger equation for an integrable Heisenberg spin model [11,12]. In QCD the integrability remains only in a small sector of the quasi-partonic operators [13]. In the case of N=4 SYM the equations for other sets of operators are also integrable [14–16]. Evolution equations for quasi-partonic operators are written in an explicitly super-conformal form in Ref. [17].

372,372,"RemarkThe purely radiative spacetimes used as reference solutions in our analysis are not perturbations of the Minkowski spacetime. A way of seeing this is to consider the Newman–Penrose constants of the spacetime. The Newman–Penrose constants are a set of absolutely conserved quantities defined as integrals of certain components of the Weyl tensor and the Maxwell fields over cuts of null infinity—see [19–21] for the Einstein–Maxwell case. In [22] it has been shown that the value of the Newman–Penrose constants for a vacuum radiative spacetime coincides with the value of the rescaled Weyl spinor at i+—this result can be extended to the electrovacuum case using the methods of this article. For the radiative spacetimes arising from the construction of [17] it can be seen that the value of the Weyl spinor at i+ is essentially the mass quadrupole of the seed static spacetime. It follows, that the Newman–Penrose constants of the radiative spacetime can take arbitrary values. On the other hand, for the Minkowski spacetime, the Newman–Penrose constants are exactly zero, and those of perturbations thereof will be small. Thus, in this precise sense, our radiative spacetimes are, generically, not perturbations of the Minkowski spacetime, unless all the Newman–Penrose constants vanish.

373,373,"Zirconium alloys are commonly used as the fuel cladding for water cooled nuclear fission reactors, mainly due to their low neutron cross-section, good corrosion resistance during normal operating conditions and sufficient mechanical strength [1]. Despite high corrosion resistance at normal operating temperatures (around 300 °C) [2], Zr alloys oxidise very rapidly when exposed to temperatures a few hundred degrees higher. This is an exothermic reaction, which can further accelerate oxidation and, at temperatures beyond 1000 °C, potentially lead to disintegration of the fuel rods, as highlighted during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. For this reason new research activities have been initiated worldwide to develop accident tolerant fuels (ATF). Additionally, ATFs could also provide further enhancements in corrosion performance during normal operating conditions enabling the development of fuel assemblies for very high burn-up.

374,374,"In the calculations for the formation energy, the box size is set to 30a0×30a0×30a0, where a0 is the bcc Fe lattice parameter. For all calculations periodic boundary conditions and constant volume are used. The Monte Carlo algorithm used to determine the lowest energy configuration of the cluster [28] is organised as follows. First, the energetics of voids without helium are investigated. A vacancy is introduced into the simulation cell and the system is minimised using a conjugate gradient algorithm, yielding a single vacancy formation energy Evac of 1.72eV. Next, the atom with the highest potential energy is removed from the system and again the system is minimised. This scheme is iteratively continued to create voids up to the number of target vacancies and the formation energy of each is calculated. Next, helium atoms are introduced to the vacancies. The total system energy is measured and recorded. At this point, a Metropolis MC scheme [29] is used to find the low energy configurations. Every helium in the system is randomly displaced from its site up to a maximum of rmax (4.5Å, the cut off distance for He–He interactions) in each of the x, y and z directions and then minimised using the conjugate gradient algorithm. Each bubble is continued for a minimum of 10,000 steps. After that, the searches will be terminated if the system energy does not drop within a further 10 steps. A schematic of this iterative process is shown in Fig. 1.

375,375,"Despite the fact that SRC-HE reduces the number of FEs, audio measurements extraction based on SRC would still be not suitable for real-time applications [39]. The previous SRC-HE module is then replaced by the generalised cross correlation phase transform (GCC-PHAT) introduced in Section 2.1, as this does not involve cumbersome point function estimations. The drawback is that the basic GCC algorithm can only detect one source at a time and it is known to be sensitive to room reverberations [5], however it is still effective under moderate reverberant environments (T60≈0.3s) [40]. For these reasons, at first experiments where only a speaker is active at any given time are carried out, as it often happens in a polite conversation between two or more people. Speech segments using a voice activity detector (VAD) [41] are further extracted and processed using a GCC-PHAT step, for the signal to be more robust to reverberations. Thus, the measure vector obtained za (see Section 2.1) can now be rewritten as za={τm(t)}, where each component τm is the TDOA collected at the m-th microphone pair at each time step t. Since TDOAs are not linear in the speaker position, they must be input into an extended Kalman filter (EKF), as in [10] to get an audio position estimation.

377,377,"The proposed multihop routing protocol, PHASeR, applies the technique of blind forwarding in a MWSN, which increases the reliability of data delivery through its inherent use of multiple routes. This approach requires a gradient metric to be continuously maintained, which is problematic in a dynamic topology. The literature commonly uses either flooding or location awareness, however flooding creates large amounts of overhead and location determination schemes can often be inaccurate, power hungry and create the issue of the dead end problem. PHASeR uses a novel method of gradient maintenance in a mobile network, which requires the proactive sharing of only local topology information. This is facilitated by a global TDMA (time division multiple access) MAC (medium access control) layer and further reduces the amount of overhead, which in turn will decrease packet latency. PHASeR is also set apart by its use of encapsulation, which allows data from multiple nodes to be transmitted in the same packet in order to handle high volumes of traffic. It utilises node cooperation to create a robust multipath routing solution. As such, the contribution of this paper is a cross-layer routing protocol for MWSNs that can handle the constant flow of data from sensors in highly mobile situations.

It is at this time in the cosmological evolution that CP violation is most efficient. After the fields have relaxed to their vacuum values, our CP violation mechanism turns off. We plan to discuss more details, in particular applications to concrete baryogenesis models, in a future publication [20].

This was in contrast to disturbance waves where the velocity of individual waves only increased slightly with the axial extent of these waves.

The breakup cross-sections also appear to demonstrate that these nuclei possess a stronger structural overlap with an α–Xn–α configuration, although the reaction mechanics by which this final state is reached may be complex. That is to say that the dominant structural mode of the neutron rich isotopes may be identified with two alpha-particles plus valence neutrons. These comprehensive measurements of the neutron-removal and cluster breakup for the first time provide experimental data whereby the structure of the most neutron-rich Be isotopes can be modeled via their reactions.

These include a performance analysis of a blood-flow LB solver using a range of sparse and non-sparse geometries [21] and a performance prediction model for lattice-Boltzmann solvers [22,23]. This performance prediction model can be applied largely to our HemeLB application, although HemeLB uses a different decomposition technique and performs real-time rendering and visualisation tasks during the LB simulations. Mazzeo and Coveney [1] studied the scalability of an earlier version of HemeLB. However, the current performance characteristics of HemeLB are substantially enhanced due to numerous subsequent advances in the code, amongst others: an improved hierarchical, compressed file format; the use of ParMETIS to ensure good load-balance; the coalesced communication patterns to reduce the overhead of rendering; use of compile-time polymorphism to avoid virtual function calls in inner loops.

More concretely, we generalize the one-loop partition functions, as derived in [11,13] for levels being odd, to the case of even levels. Moreover, on the level of partition functions we implement additional dressings of the world-sheet parity symmetry and identify them with the dressings introduced in [12] in the crosscap state approach. As expected, all the physical information can be read off entirely from the various amplitudes. We will end up with a collection of very explicit and general one-loop partition functions and tadpole cancellation conditions covering simple current extensions of all 168 Gepner models with additional dressings of the parity symmetry. In fact providing a compact collection of the main relevant formulas for constructing supersymmetric Gepner model orientifolds was one of the motivations for writing this Letter.

Furthermore, PAs can function as biomimetic materials exemplified by collagen-mimetic PAs [92]. Conventional materials often rely on electrospinning as a manufacturing method to achieve fiber-like structures suitable for use in nerve regeneration. The self-assembly nature of PAs allows them to circumvent costly manufacturing methods. However, in contrast to conventional manufacturing methods like electrospinning where quality and batch-to-batch variability can be tightly controlled, merely relying on self-assembly as a method of large-scale commercial production is still an experimental concept. Perhaps the next step would be to carefully compare and contrast the robustness of self-assemled PAs to electrospun nanofibers. Given that the constituent elements in PAs and external factors like pH can affect its structural assembly, parameters must be finely tuned and optimized in order for PA nanofibers to be used as a full-fledged commercialized medical product [93].

Childs et al. [1] use this algorithm to show quantum walk search to be fundamentally more effective than classical random walk search by presenting a class of graphs (the GT graphs) that force classical random walks to make exponentially many queries to an oracle encoding the structure of the graph, but that are traversable by quantum walks with a polynomial number of queries to such an oracle. In order to study the robustness of the algorithm to the detrimental effects of decoherence, we shall determine how effectively it achieves its goal when subjected to an increasing degree of phase damping noise. For this reason, we will focus on the probability that the walker is on the target vertex at the end of the walk.

391,391,"In contrast to the H particle, the situation for the Θ+ baryon is very promising. Thus, in this Letter we explore the formation of the Θ+-baryon within a new approach called parton-based Gribov–Regge theory. It is realized in the Monte Carlo program NEXUS 3.97 [22,23]. In this model high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions are treated within a self-consistent quantum mechanical multiple scattering formalism. Elementary interactions, happening in parallel, correspond to underlying microscopic (predominantly soft) parton cascades and are described effectively as phenomenological soft pomeron exchanges. A pomeron can be seen as layers of a (soft) parton ladder, which is attached to projectile and target nucleons via leg partons. At high energies one accounts also for the contribution of perturbative (high pt) partons described by a so-called “semihard pomeron”—a piece of the QCD parton ladder sandwiched between two soft pomerons which are connected to the projectile and to the target in the usual way. The spectator partons of both projectile and target nucleons, left after pomeron emissions, form nucleon remnants. The legs of the pomerons form color singlets, such as q–q̄, q–qq or q̄–q̄q̄. The probability of q–qq and q̄–q̄q̄ is controlled by the parameter Pqq and is fixed by the experimental yields on (multi-)strange baryons [23].

392,392,"In contrast with polymers, which are typically synthesized in the liquid phase, SWNTs are produced through a variety of synthesis techniques that typically involve the reaction of a gaseous carbon feedstock to form the nanotubes on catalyst particles. MWNTs were first observed in arc discharge fullerene reactors [1,26]; this technique was later adapted to produce SWNTs [3]. Similarly, the fullerene production method of laser ablation [27] was adapted to produce SWNTs (∼1.4nm diameter) in larger quantities on metal catalyst particles [28–30]. A number of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes have been developed to grow SWNTs and MWNTs, all involving the reaction of a gaseous carbon compound as feedstock. These processes include fluidized bed [31], “carpet” growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from catalyst particles embedded in a substrate [32–35] as shown in Fig. 3, and “catalytic gas flow CVD” [36,37]. One of the most effective, cheap, and scalable CVD techniques is the HiPco (high-pressure CO) process, which does not use pre-formed catalyst particles unlike most other CVD techniques [38].

The final adhesion and cohesive strength of the bond are influenced by numerous factors including the surface energies of the adhesive and substrate, dwell time, contact pressure, mechanical properties of the adhesive, as well as environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity [8]. Therefore, tack is important in many applications where an instant bond is required, however it is equally important when a ‘clean’ separation of the initially bonded surfaces is desirable. Many different methods for measuring the tack have been devised with the four main ones being the rolling ball, loop tack, quick stick and probe tack tests [9]. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages and the specific testing method should be selected based on the particular application.

ANN basic architecture consists of networks of primitive functions capable of receiving multiple weighted inputs that are evaluated in terms of their success at discriminating the classes in Τa. Different types of primitive functions and network configurations result in varying models (Hastie et al., 2009; Rojas, 1996). During training network connection weights are adjusted if the separation of inputs and predefined classes incurs an error. Convergence proceeds until the reduction in error between iterations reaches a decay threshold (Kotsiantis, 2007; Rojas, 1996).

396,396,"Using measured data from two arable sites in the UK we have shown that lags can have significant impact on model evaluation and can affect both the level of correlation between measured and simulated data and the magnitude of the sums of the residuals. Also, we used the division of MSE to three constituent statistics (SB, SDSD and LCS) to show how the level of correlation can affect the sum of residuals. By dividing the algorithm-predicted series of lag values into monthly sets and examining the frequency distribution of the lags, certain patterns in these temporally patchy series have been identified. A challenging task in relation to time lags between observed and simulated daily data, is to determine their cause. This task becomes more difficult for model outputs such as soil N2O emissions that are driven by various interacting variables. Even more so, because the measured N2O datasets and the measured datasets of their drivers (e.g. soil moisture, soil N content) cover small time periods, they are not continuous and can vary widely in size. In this study we implemented the algorithm using measured and simulated data for soil moisture (first and second example) and soil mineral N (second example), and compared its results with the respective results for N2O. In our first example, we showed that the estimated lags in N2O prediction are related to the lags in soil moisture prediction in a way that changes gradually through time. In our second example, the lags in N2O prediction were explained by the lags in soil moisture and soil mineral N prediction, with which they had a positive relationship.

397,397,"This study proposes a new framework of a numerical modelling of the gas exchange between air and water across their interface, and subsequent chemical reaction in water based on an extended two-compartment model. The major purpose of this study is to provide a fundamental concept for modelling physicochemical processes of the gas exchange, followed by the chemical reaction in water. Demonstrating fundamental data and knowledge on the important environmental transport phenomena, especially the effects of the Schmidt number and the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms across the interface have also been attempted. The gas exchange processes are separated into two physicochemical substeps, the first is the gas–liquid equilibrium between the two phases, and the second is the chemical reaction in the water phase. A first-order, irreversible chemical reaction of the gaseous material after its uptake into the water phase is assumed here to simplify interactions of the chemical reactions and turbulent transport phenomena in water. While a traditional two-compartment model assumes uniform concentration of a material in each compartment, the present two-compartment model uses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique in the water compartment to evaluate temporal development of three-dimensional profiles of the velocity and concentration fields. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach is used to evaluate profiles of fluid velocities and concentrations in water, and several important turbulence statistics have been evaluated without using turbulent closures, and subgrid-scale models. We assume that a fluid flow in the water phase is a well-developed turbulent water layer of a low Reynolds number, and the Schmidt number is varied from 1 to 8 to observe the effects of the molecular diffusion of the gas in sub-interface water on the gas exchange rate at the interface. Six degrees of the nondimensional chemical reaction rate are used to find the effect of the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms. Extrapolations of the gas exchange rates and the related transport phenomena toward larger Schmidt number and the faster chemical reaction rate will also be examined to predict the gas exchange processes of the actual gases of Sc∼O(102) based on results from the present numerical experiments.

Hybrid mesons, qq̄ states with an admixture of gluons, and glueballs, states with no quark content, rely on the self interaction property of gluons due to their color charge. Looking for glueballs would be the most obvious way to find evidence for states with constituent gluons; however, the search is hindered by the fact that these states may significantly mix with regular qq̄-mesons in the region where the lightest are predicted to occur. As such, they may not be observable as pure states and disentangling the observed spectra may be a very difficult task. Instead, hybrid mesons (qq̄gn) may be a better place to search for evidence of resonances outside the constituent quark model, especially since the lightest of theses states are predicted to have exotic quantum numbers of spin, parity, and charge conjugation, JPC, that is, combinations that are unattainable by regular qq̄-mesons.

Furthermore of interest are the buffer values of the respective buffers at the time of the user's interaction with the simulation (e.g., the input buffer of a certain machine at the time of refilling it). A relatively high average buffer value can e.g. signify that the users do not trust that the respective mode of process monitoring conveys the need for interaction in time, leading the users to switching their attention to the process simulation in regular intervals, and performing interactions just in case. A low average buffer can, on the other hand, signify that the users rely on the respective conditions’ ability to signal interaction needs. On the other hand, if e.g. an input buffer had already been completely depleted at the time of intervention, this may signify that the respective condition has failed to inform the users in time.

400,400,"The first step of PB, the enumeration of the conditional sample space through abductive logic programming, could be compared to “logical inference” in ProbLog [9]. While both languages aim to generate a propositional formula and compile it into a decision diagram, “logical inference” in PB is based on abductive logic programming, while ProbLog grounds the relevant parts of the probabilistic program. Moreover, in PB compilation of the boolean formulas is performed using (RO)BDDs, while ProbLog can use a wider range of decision diagrams, e.g. sentential decision diagrams (SDD), deterministic, decomposable negation normal form (d-DNNF). These differences reflect the different aims of the two PPLs: ProbLog focuses on models where “logical inference” needs to be efficient, and the resulting representation, the decision diagrams, need to be compact, while PB focuses on models where “logical inference” is typically easy, however it must be applied repeatedly, according to the nature and the number of the observations. However, in future work, PB could benefit from the use of more compact decision diagrams.

401,401,"For decades, vibronic coupling models [1–4] have served as bridges connecting nuclear dynamics studies with the static studies of electronic structure calculations [5]. The vibronic coupling model is a simple polynomial expansion of diabatic potential energy surfaces and couplings. The expansion coefficients are chosen so that the eigenvalues of the potential operator map on to the adiabatic potential surfaces. This diabatisation by ansatz circumvents many of the problems of describing non-adiabatic systems. It is also the inspiration for a diabatisation scheme that is used in modern, direct-dynamic methods that include non-adiabatic effects [6]. For a model Hamiltonian to correctly approximate the eigenvectors of the true Hamiltonian it has to span the totally symmetric irreducible representation (IrRep) of the point groups the molecule belongs to, at the appropriate symmetric geometries [7]. In recent times, many articles have demonstrated the advantages of using symmetry when constructing analytic model potentials [8–12], most often in the context of permutation-inversion groups [13].

402,402,"On the other hand, the other local fields except the gravitational field are not always localized on the brane even in the warped geometry. Indeed, in the Randall–Sundrum model in five dimensions [2], the following facts are well known: spin 0 field is localized on a brane with positive tension which also localizes the graviton while the spin 1/2 and 3/2 fields are localized not on a brane with positive tension but on a brane with negative tension [6]. Spin 1 field is not localized neither on a brane with positive tension nor on a brane with negative tension [7]. In six space–time dimensions, the spin 1 gauge field is also localized on the brane [8]. Thus, in order to fulfill the localization of Standard Model particles on a brane with positive tension, it seems that some additional interactions except the gravitational interaction must be also introduced in the bulk. There is a lot of papers devoted to the different localization mechanisms of the bulk fields in various brane world models.

403,403,"In addition, the prediction of solar cell’s temperature is very important for the electrical characterisation of CPV modules. Rodrigo et al. (2014) reviewed various methods for the calculation of the cell temperature in High Concentrator PV (HCPV) modules. The methods were categorised based on: (1) heat sink temperature, (2) electrical parameters and (3) atmospheric parameters. The first two categories are based on direct measurements of CPV modules in indoor or outdoor experimental setups and presented the highest degree of accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 1.7–2.5K). Most of the methods reviewed by Rodrigo et al. (2014) calculate the cell temperature at open-circuit conditions. Methods that predict the cell temperature at maximum power point (MPP) operation offer a more realistic approach since they include the electrical energy generation of the solar cells (i.e. real operating conditions); Yandt et al. (2012) described a method predicting the cell temperature at MPP based on electrical parameters and Fernández et al. (2014b) based on heat sink temperature with absolute RMSE 0.55–1.44K. Fernández et al. (2014a) also proposed an artificial neural network model to estimate the cell temperature based on atmospheric parameters and an open-circuit voltage model based on electrical parameters (Fernandez et al., 2013a) offering good accuracy (RMSE 3.2K and 2.5K respectively (Rodrigo et al., 2014)). The main disadvantage of the aforementioned methods is that an experimental setup is required to obtain the parameters used for the cell temperature calculation.

404,404,"Another remarkable feature of the quantum field treatment can be revealed from the investigation of the vacuum state. For a classical field, vacuum is realized by simply setting the potential to zero resulting in an unaltered, free evolution of the particle's plane wave (|ψI〉=|ψIII〉=|k0〉). In the quantized treatment, vacuum is represented by an initial Fock state |n0=0〉 which still interacts with the particle and yields as final state |ΨIII〉 behind the field region(19)|ΨI〉=|k0〉⊗|0〉⇒|ΨIII〉=∑n=0∞t0n|k−n〉⊗|n〉 with a photon exchange probability(20)P0,n=|t0n|2=1n!e−Λ2Λ2n The particle thus transfers energy to the vacuum field leading to a Poissonian distributed final photon number. Let's consider, for example, a superconducting resonant circuit as source of the field. The magnetic field along the axis of a properly shaped coil is well approximated by the rectangular form. A particle with a magnetic dipole moment passing through the coil then interacts with the circuit and excites it with a measurable loss of kinetic energy even if the circuit is initially uncharged and there is classically no field it can couple to. The phenomenon that vacuum in quantum field theory does not mean to “no influence” as known from Casimir forces or Lamb shift is clearly visible here as well.

405,405,"The mesoporous silica particles were prepared by the surfactant self-assembly method described previously [18,24]. Briefly, a homogeneous solution of the soluble silica precursor, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO), and hydrochloric acid was mixed in ethanol and water. A surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO), with an initial concentration much less than the critical micelle concentration was added to lower the surface tension of the liquid mixture and act as the mesoporous structure-directing template. Aerosol solutions of soluble silica plus surfactant were then generated with nitrogen as a carrier atomizing gas using a commercially available atomizer (Model 9392A, TSI, Inc., St. Paul, MN). The aerosol droplets were solidified in a tube furnace at 400°C until dry. Once dried, a durapore membrane filter, kept at 80°C, was used to collect the particles. As a final step, the surfactant was removed at 400°C for 5h via calcination. The surface of the mesoporous silica core in these studies was chemically modified with 10wt.% or 15wt.% by aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) conducted identically as previously described [17] to create a positive surface charge to increase loading efficiency of negatively charged cargo. Further, Liu and colleagues report the colloidal stability of these protocells with lipid bilayers, excess amount of liposomes (50μg liposomes per 0.5mg silica were used [18]).

406,406,"Multi-phase flows are common, in fact quite general, in environmental and industrial processes. Broadly these may be modelled as continuous problems where phases are mixed (e.g. oil–water homogenisation [36], sediment transport [18]) or interface problems where phases are distinct and interact at the interface (e.g. gas-assisted injection moulding [21], liquid jet breakup [40]). In some cases flows start as interface problems but as mixing occurs at the interface they become effectively continuous, at least locally. Air entrainment, perhaps due to wave breaking, is an obvious example. We consider here two-phase interface problems where the interface remains distinct and the density difference is high, e.g. air and water, and where one phase may be considered incompressible. The interface is transient and may become highly distorted and interconnected. Such problems have been tackled with mesh-based methods using periodic (or adaptive) re-meshing or additional phase tracking functions [40]. However, these approaches can be time-consuming to implement and prone to errors in surface representation [50] or mass conservation [34].

407,407,"Each hit position inside the drift chambers was calculated from the drift time digitized by a flash analog-to-digital converter. The calculation was carried out based on a relation between the hit position and the drift time (x–t relation). The x–t relation was precisely calculated by a drift chamber simulation package, GARFIELD [20], and a gas property simulation package, MAGBOLTZ [21]. Although the chambers were constructed carefully with a tolerance of 100 μm, there was a small position deviation of wires and field-shaping patterns, which could locally modify the electric field. In order to take account of the limited accuracy in the chamber manufacturing, a correction was commonly applied to the calculated x–t relation throughout the experiments. The correction was obtained to minimize the χ2 in the fitting of straight tracks of clean muon events observed on the ground without magnetic field. The correction was as small as expected from the accuracy in the chamber manufacturing. During the observations, the x–t relation was affected by the variation in the pressure and temperature of the chamber gas. In order to take account of these time-dependent variations, the x–t relation was calibrated for each data-taking run. Especially in calibrating the x–t relation of ODCs, an absolute reference positions were provided by SciFi, which are not affected by the variation in the pressure nor temperature.

Further insights to the performance potential could be given through the assessment of the protocol with other mobilities that can extend the physical region of movement as well as impose potential restrictions on the nodes mobility, for example by forcing similar nodes to move within specifically defined areas. Secondly, the different forwarding modes introduced in Section  3.3 express different levels of cooperation across the network. The push-community mode, for example, is a form of interest-community selfishness and assumes reciprocation in the nodes’ behaviour. The vulnerability (resp. resilience) of the protocol to different instances of node misbehaviours is a research item worth exploring.

409,409,"A convenient and widely reported technique for detection of the GP involves measurements of the complex shear modulus, G∗, over a range of frequencies, ω, in oscillatory shear. At the GP the elastic and viscous components of the complex modulus, G′ and G″, respectively scale in oscillatory frequency, ω, as G′(ω)∼G″(ω)∼ωα where α is termed the stress relaxation exponent [15]. Thus, the GP may be identified as the instant where the G′ and G″ scale in frequency according to identical power laws [15], behaviour corresponding to attainment of a frequency independent phase angle, δ(=atan(G″/G′)). GP measurements may involve ‘frequency sweeps’ with repeated consecutive application of a set of small amplitude oscillatory shear, SAOS, waveforms [15,16], or by Fourier Transform Mechanical Spectroscopy, FTMS, in which G∗(ω) is found by simultaneous application of several harmonic frequencies in a composite waveform and its subsequent Fourier analysis [17,18]. Frequency sweeps are limited to relatively slow gelation processes due to sample mutation and interpolation errors [9,19,20]. FTMS may overcome these limitations, but is unsuitable for markedly strain sensitive materials, such as fibrin gels, due to the strain amplitude of the composite waveform exceeding the linear viscoelastic range (LVR) [9].

410,410,"The scheduling process we adopt matches a multiple stage stochastic programming approach. Standard two-stage stochastic programs with linear or convex functions are often solved using the L-shaped method or Bender's decomposition [44,6,7]. However, our recourse decision (scheduled cancellations) is still anticipative to further uncertainty, namely the second shift surgery durations, unavailability and cancellations. As such, the decision problem can be viewed as a three-stage recourse model [5,6]. Solving the scheduling problem is further complicated because the recourse function is integer. Laporte and Louveaux [26] propose modified L-shaped decomposition with adjusted optimal cuts for two stage stochastic program with integer recourse. Angulo et al. [1] alternately generate optimal cuts of the linear sub-problem and the integer sub-problem, which improves the practical convergence (see also [15,8]). We follow a sample average approximation approach (SAA) which uses this framework. Moreover, we prove and exploit a specific relationship between the first-stage realization and the optimal number of scheduled cancellations to speed up the computation of integer cuts. We use Jensen's inequality [17] to upper bound the minus second (and third) stage cost, a technique that was proposed by Batun et al. [3].

411,411,"Isogeometric analysis. The central idea of isogeometric analysis is to use the same ansatz functions for the discretization of the partial differential equation at hand, as are used for the representation of the problem geometry.

This concept, originally invented in  [1] for finite element methods (IGAFEM) has proved very fruitful in applications  [1,2]; see also the monograph  [3]. Since CAD directly provides a parametrization of the boundary ∂Ω, this makes the boundary element method (BEM) the most attractive numerical scheme, if applicable (i.e., provided that the fundamental solution of the differential operator is explicitly known). Isogeometric BEM (IGABEM) has first been considered for 2D BEM in  [4] and for 3D BEM in  [5]. Unlike standard BEM with piecewise polynomials which is well-studied in the literature, cf. the monographs  [6,7] and the references therein, the numerical analysis of IGABEM is essentially open. We only refer to  [2,8–10] for numerical experiments and to  [11] for some quadrature analysis. In particular, a posteriori error estimation has been well-studied for standard BEM, e.g.,  [12–18] as well as the recent overview article  [19], but has not been treated for IGABEM so far.

Since Google Maps/Earth server only gives the terrain data in graphical display, we have to get terrain digital data from other sources. The fine-resolution (3″ or finer) terrain data bases such as SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographical Mission) or USGS's DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data are necessary. Moreover, since 3DWF is used to model the fine-scale (meters up to 100m) atmospheric flow, it needs fine resolution terrain data. In this project, we use the terrain elevation data set from SRTM (Farr et al. 2007) with 3-arcsecond (~90m resolution at the equator) resolution. The data covers the land area, nearly global from 56S to 60N latitudes. We use the processed version 4 SRTM data set as described in Gamache (2005) in which some of the missing data holes were filled.

When the data are applied to the 3DWF model, they are transformed to the local East, North and Up (ENU) coordinate (see Fig. 3). Since the 3DWF is a fine scale wind model and its entire model domain is not intended to be larger than 20×20km, this Cartesian coordinate system is a good choice with very little distortion due to the curvature of the Earth's surface.

The correlated response methods were performed with an all-electron atomic natural orbital (ANO) basis set contracted to 6s5p4d3f1g on manganese, [47] together with the cc-pVTZ basis set on the oxygen atoms. The all-electron correlated calculations invoked a 13 orbital frozen core (O 1s, Mn 1s2s2p3s3p). Trial calculations correlating these orbitals only had a minor effect on excitation energies. For comparison the EOM-CCSD method with the cc-pVTZ basis on all atoms was tested to compare with LR-CCSD. These formally give exactly the same excitation energies, although the transition moments are more accurate for LR-CCSD. Abelian symmetry (D2) was used in all correlated excited state calculations.

A complete error analysis of the space semidiscrete Galerkin scheme is provided. The theory covers the practically very important case of nonsmooth initial data and right hand side. The analysis relies essentially on some new regularity results of the multi-term time fractional diffusion equation. Further, we have developed a fully discrete scheme based on a finite difference discretization of the Caputo fractional derivatives. The stability and error estimate of the fully discrete scheme were established, provided that the solution is smooth. The extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimension fully confirmed our convergence analysis: the empirical convergence rates agree well with the theoretical predictions for both smooth and nonsmooth data.

418,418,"Numerical simulation of the gas flow through such non-trivial internal geometries is, however, extremely challenging. This is because conventional continuum fluid dynamics, which assumes that locally a gas is close to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, becomes invalid or inaccurate as the smallest characteristic scale of the geometry (e.g. the channel height) approaches the mean distance between molecular collisions, λ [1]. An accurate and flexible modelling alternative for these cases is the direct simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) [2]. However, DSMC can be prohibitively expensive for internal-flow applications, which typically have a geometry of high-aspect ratio (i.e. are extremely long, relative to their cross-section). The high-aspect ratio creates a formidable multiscale problem: processes need to be resolved occurring over the smallest characteristic scale of the geometry (e.g. a channelʼs height), as well as over the largest characteristic scale of the geometry (e.g. the length of a long channel network), simultaneously.

419,419,"A limitation of the pharmacyte approach is the one-time nature of the intervention: ACT T-cells can only be loaded once with a cargo of adjuvant drug prior to transfer, and the duration of stimulation is inherently limited by expansion of the cell population in vivo, since cell-bound particles are diluted with each cell division. We hypothesized that a strategy to target supporting drugs to T-cells with nanoparticle drug carriers directly in vivo would enable transferred lymphocytes to be repeatedly stimulated with supporting adjuvant drugs, and thereby provide continuous supporting signals over the prolonged durations that might be necessary for elimination of large tumor burdens. Such “re-arming” of T-cells with supporting drugs could be achieved by repeated administration of targeted particles, allowing adoptively-transferred T-cells to be restimulated multiple times directly in vivo, while the use of internalizing targeting ligands would minimize the likelihood of immune responses against the nanoparticle carrier. To our knowledge, only two prior studies have attempted to target nanoparticles to T-cells in vivo [17,18]. In both of these studies, particles were targeted to T-cells via peptide-MHC ligands that bind to specific T-cell receptors. However, peptide-MHC-functionalized nanoparticles have recently been shown to deliver an anergizing/tolerizing signal to T-cells [18,19] — which is ideal for treating graft rejection or autoimmunity, but runs counter to the goals of cancer immunotherapy.

420,420,"Fig. 11 shows the wear-mode map of RH ceramics, in which the early-stage friction coefficients and the surface roughness of the pure surface were chosen. The value of the fracture toughness of RH ceramics was calculated based on the reference data in other literature [22]. The Sc of RH ceramics was smaller than Sc,critical under all tested conditions during the initial stage of friction. Thus, the initial wear mode of RH ceramics was powder formation or plowing. In addition, powder formation and plowing can be distinguished using a dimensionless parameter (Sc⁎) and a critical parameter (Sc,critical⁎).(3)Sc⁎=HvRmaxKIc(4)Sc,critical⁎=51+10μwhere Hv is the Vickers hardness of RH ceramics [Pa]. The initial wear mode of RH ceramics was determined as powder formation under all tested conditions, as demonstrated in Fig. 12(a). Furthermore, the wear-mode map at 2×104 cycles was constructed, as shown in Fig. 12(b). In the map, all plots moved near the transition curve to plowing. In particular, the plots for RH ceramics sliding against stainless steel or Al2O3 balls were nearer than SiC or Si3N4 balls. Therefore, RH ceramics sliding against SiC and Si3N4 balls showed relatively higher wear than the other counterpart materials. Nevertheless, these results from the wear-mode maps indicated that the wear mode of RH ceramics was powder formation accompanied with microcracks under all tested conditions in this study, resulting in low wear (<5×10−9mm2/N). Indeed, the observation of the worn surfaces revealed that the catastrophic wear of RH ceramics accompanied by large brittle fracture was prevented overall, as shown in Fig. 13.

In addition, only limited kinds of set data could be shown as the system was limited to well-formed Euler diagrams. Compound graphs can be used to represent restricted kinds of grouped network data [8]. Graph clusters are visualized with transparent hulls by Santamaria and Theron [39]. However, the technique removes edges from the graph and it is not sufficiently sophisticated for arbitrary overlapping sets. Itoh et al. [24] proposed to overlay pie-like glyphs over the nodes in a graph to encode multiple categories. Each set is hence represented using disconnected regions that are linked by having the same colour. This causes difficulties with tasks that involve finding relations between sets such as T1, T3 and T4 in Section 5.3.

423,423,"It is known that as the temperature of the sample rises, the Lorentz mechanism remains dominant until Tc of steel is reached (770°C for a low carbon steel), when the magnetostrictive mechanism becomes more efficient [15]. Previously this has been thought due to a thin ferromagnetic oxide layer on the sample surface, the surface being cooler than the bulk of the material [16,17]. This layer concentrates the magnetic field, increasing generation efficiency. Recent studies also show that rearrangement of the magnetic moments from ordered domains to a disordered state at a magnetic phase transition lowers the magnetostrictive constant. This ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition is accompanied by large changes in the efficiency of electromagnetic ultrasound generation leading to the use of EMATs as a method of studying phase transitions in magnetic alloys [18].

As well, the location of this segregation cannot be determined exactly in the molten pool or later in the re-solidified material.

This study described perceptions of local EMR stakeholders in two urban slum clinics. They shared many observations that may be important for other EMR initiatives to heed, and worried most about the sustainability of EMR initiatives in like communities. The future for EMR use in urban slums is promising. Innovative new technologies, such as mobile applications and point-of-care laboratory tests, could extend the reach of EMRs where infrastructure is wanting. New cloud-based EMR ecosystems, where data is collected and stored centrally could leverage cell phone networks to promote more health information sharing, coordination of care and ultimately better outcomes for vulnerable populations.Summary pointsWhat was already known on the topic?•Rapid urbanization is associated with growth in the number and size of urban slums and an associated rise in the burden of disease, further worsening an already fragmented and inefficient health care system.

429,429,"Table 1 lists 8 pairs of B decays. In fact, there are more decay pairs, since many of the particles in the final states can be observed as either pseudoscalar (P) or vector (V) mesons. Note that certain decays are written in terms of VV final states, while others are have PP states. There are three reasons for this. First, some decays involve a final-state π0. However, experimentally it will be necessary to find the decay vertices of the final particles. This is virtually impossible for a π0, and so we always use a ρ0. Second, some pairs of decays are related by SU(3) in the SM only if an (ss¯) quark pair is used. However, there are no P's which are pure (ss¯). The mesons η and η′ have an (ss¯) component, but they also have significant (uu¯) and (dd¯) pieces. As a result the b¯→s¯ and b¯→d¯ decays are not really related by SU(3) in the SM if the final state involves an η or η′. We therefore consider instead the vector meson ϕ which is essentially a pure (ss¯) quark state. Finally, we require that both B0 and B¯0 be able to decay to the final state. This cannot happen if the final state contains a single K0 (or K¯0) meson. However, it can occur if this final-state particle is an excited neutral kaon. In this case one decay involves K*0, while the other has K¯*0. Assuming that the vector meson is detected via its decay to ψKsπ0 (as in the measurement of sin2β via Bd0(t)→J/ψK*), then both B0 and B¯0 can decay to the same final state.

430,430,"The need to represent scale interactions in weather and climate prediction models has, for many decades, motivated research into the use of adaptive meshes [3,34,38]. R-adaptivity – mesh redistribution – involves deforming a mesh in order to vary local resolution and was first considered for atmospheric modelling more than twenty years ago by Dietachmayer and Droegemeier [14]. It is an attractive form of adaptivity since it does not involve altering the mesh connectivity, does not create load balancing problems because points are never created or destroyed, does not require mapping of solutions between meshes [26], does not lead to sudden changes in resolution and can be retro-fitted into existing models. Variational methods exist which attempt to control resolution in different directions for r-adaptive meshes (e.g. [23,25]). Alternatively, the solution of the Monge–Ampère equation to generate an optimally transported (OT) mesh based on a scalar valued monitor function is a useful form of r-adaptive mesh generation because it generates a mesh equidistributed with respect to a monitor function and does not lead to mesh tangling [7]. We will see that the optimal transport problem on the sphere leads to a slightly different equation of Monge–Ampère type, which has not before been solved numerically on the surface of a sphere, which would be necessary for weather and climate prediction using r-adaptivity.

431,431,"Gas sorption, storage and separation in carbon materials are mainly based on physisorption on the surfaces and particularly depend on the electrostatic and dispersion (i.e., vdW) interactions. The former can be tuned by introducing charge variations in the material, and the latter by chemical substitution. The strength of the interaction is determined by the surface characteristics of the adsorbent and the properties of targeted adsorbate molecule, including but not limited to the size and shape of the adsorbate molecule along with its polarizability, magnetic susceptibility, permanent dipole moment, and quadrupole moment. Li et al. summarise the adsorption-related physical parameters of many gas or vapour adsorbates, and herein Table 1 we show a few of those of interest, H2, N2, CO, CO2, CH4, NH3, SO2 and H2S [90]. For instance, an adsorbent with a high specific surface area is a good candidate for adsorption of a molecule with high polarizability but no polarity. Adsorbents with highly polarised surfaces are good for adsorbate molecules with a high dipole moment. The adsorbents with high electric field gradient surfaces are found to be ideal for the high quadrupole moment adsorbate molecules [91]. Normally, the binding or adsorption strength with a carbon nanostructure is relatively low for H2 and N2; intermediate for CO, CH4 and CO2; and relatively high for H2S, NH3 and H2O. Thus, surface modifications, such as doping, functionalization and improving the pore structure and specific surface area of nanocarbons, are important to enhance gas adsorption. For this purpose, graphene offers a great scope for tailor-made carbonaceous adsorbents.

432,432,"One major goal of current nuclear physics is the observation of at least partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Since the chiral order parameter 〈q̄q〉 is expected to decrease by about 30% already at normal nuclear matter density [1–4], any in-medium change due to the dropping quark condensate should in principle be observable in photonuclear reactions. The conjecture that such a partial restoration of chiral symmetry causes a softening and narrowing of the σ meson as the chiral partner of the pion in the nuclear medium [5,6] has led to the idea of measuring the π0π0 invariant mass distribution near the 2π threshold in photon induced reactions on nuclei [7]. In contrast to its questionable nature as a proper quasiparticle in vacuum, the σ meson might develop a much narrower peak at finite baryon density due to phase-space suppression for the σ→ππ decay, hence making it possible to explore its properties when embedded in a nuclear many-body system [8–11]. Measuring a threshold enhancement of the π0π0 invariant mass spectrum might serve as a signal for the partial restoration of chiral symmetry inside nuclei and, therefore, give information about one of the most fundamental features of QCD.

433,433,"Several methods based on dynamical assumptions were suggested for determination of the P-parity of the Θ+ [13]. According to a general theorem [14], in order to determine the parity of one particle in a binary reaction one has to know polarizations at least of two fermions participating in this reaction. Model independent methods for determination of the P-parity of the Θ+ were suggested recently in Refs. [15,16] for pp-collision, and in Ref. [17] for photoproduction of the Θ+. The method of Refs. [15,16], based on the assumption that the spin of the Θ+ equals 12, suggests to measure the spin–spin correlation parameter in the reaction p→p→→Σ+Θ+ near the threshold. We generalize here this method for an arbitrary spin of the Θ+ and both isospins T=0 and T=1 of the NN channel of the NN→YΘ+ reaction. Furthermore, we consider a polarization transfer from a nucleon to the hyperon Y in this reaction. Our consideration is model independent, since it is based only on conservation of the P-parity, total angular momentum and isospin in the reaction and the generalized Pauli principle for nucleons.

434,434,"Energy conservation is critical to ensure stability of a numerical method, especially for contact and collision problems  [28,43]. A number of conserving schemes have been developed to ensure energy conservation. These schemes make use of the penalty regulation of normal contact constraint and inherit the conservation property from continuum problems. These conservation schemes can conveniently be combined with the finite element method to simulate frictionless  [44] and frictional  [43] contact and collision. Hesch and Betsch  [45] formulated the node-to-segment contact method and solved large deformation contact problems with the conserving scheme. More recently, an energy and momentum-conserving temporal discretization scheme  [46] was developed for adhesive contact problems without considering friction and dissipation. Even though the conserving scheme improves numerical stability, it also inherits from the penalty method the difficulty of having to determine penalty parameters. In order to remove penalty sensitivity, Chawla and Laursen  [47] proposed an energy and momentum conserving algorithm, which makes use of Lagrange multipliers instead of penalty parameters.

Subsequently, wafers were exposed to an Al flux for a range of times to deposit ultrathin Al layers. The samples were then oxidized at ambient temperatures in the MBE load lock to produce Al2O3 layers. The samples were transferred within 1min to an Oxford Instruments OpAL reactor and thin films of HfO2 were deposited on the Al2O3 using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The HfO2 depositions used a [(CpMe)2HfOMeMe] precursor coupled with an O2 plasma as the oxidizing species. Between 30 and 130 ALD cycles were used to grow HfO2 thicknesses from 1.6 to 7nm at 250°C. For electrical measurements, circular gold contacts of area 1.96×10−3cm2 were deposited onto the films to form MOS gate electrodes and Al was deposited on the back of the Ge wafers to provide an ohmic contact.

The biggest advantage of microscopy is that they provide intuitive real-space representations of the various morphologies. However, when it comes to “measurements”, especially in a quantitative way, microscopy sometimes lacks a statistical accuracy due to the small field of view. In contrast, the scattering methods provide much a superior statistical accuracy than that of microscopy simply because the observation volume is larger than that of the microscopes. One must remember, however, that the scattering methods normally require “(hypothesized) models” for data analysis in advance: They do not provide an intuitive insight into the morphologies as does microscopy.

438,438,"MWSN routing protocols generally take influence from both WSN and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocols, which all share common limitations, such as bandwidth, power and cost. WSNs often share the same aim as MWSNs, in that they wish to route data from many sensors to a single sink. However, WSNs are normally considered to be static and so the associated routing protocols are often unable to cope in a mobile scenario [10]. Alternatively, MANET protocols are designed to be able to cope with the mobility of nodes, however they aim to allow end-to-end communication to occur between any two nodes [2]. This extra functionality is often not required by MWSNs and so the additional overhead is unnecessary. Combined with the high packet delivery ratios and low delays that are demanded by emerging applications, the ideal routing solution for a MWSN is one that can handle the mobility of nodes and allows data to be forwarded from the sensors to the sink in a reliable and timely manner. This set of requirements make the problem of routing in a MWSN a unique challenge, which will require new specifically designed solutions. For this reason there have been many routing protocols designed for MWSNs. As such, this section will give an overview of the current literature, which highlights the different techniques and commonly used protocols in MWSN routing.

440,440,"Copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloadditions have been recently extensively studied by polymer chemists for the synthesis of functional polymers (either end-functional or side-functional). The post-functionalization of synthetic polymers is an important feature of macromolecular engineering as many polymerization mechanisms are rather sensitive to the presence of bulky or functional groups. For example, a wide variety of telechelic polymers (i.e. polymers with defined chain-ends) can be efficiently prepared using a combination of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and CuAAC. This strategy was independently reported in early 2005 by van Hest and Opsteen [31], Lutz et al. [32], and Matyjaszewski et al. [33]. Such step was important since ATRP is a very popular polymerization method in modern materials science [34,35]. Indeed, ATRP is a facile technique, which allows the preparation of well-defined polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution, predictable chain length, controlled microstructure, defined chain-ends and controlled architecture [36–41]. However, the range of possibilities of ATRP can be further broadened by CuAAC. For instance, the ω-bromine chain-ends of polymers prepared by ATRP can be transformed into azides by nucleophilic substitution and subsequently reacted with functional alkynes (Scheme 3) [32]. Due to the very high chemoselectivity of CuAAC, this method is highly modular and may be used to synthesize a wide range of ω-functional polymers. Moreover, the formed triazole rings are not “passive” spacers but interesting functions exhibiting H-bonds capability, aromaticity and rigidity.

Nevertheless, following Lüscher [6], Abdalla, Forger and Gomes showed [7] that, in a G/H sigma model with H simple,11Here, and throughout this Letter, we shall use ‘simple’ to mean that the corresponding Lie algebra has no non-trivial ideals. Hence U(1) is simple in our terminology, in addition to the usual non-Abelian simple groups of the Cartan–Killing classification [13]. the first conserved non-local charge survives quantization (after an appropriate renormalization [6–8]), which suffices to ensure quantum integrability of the theory. By contrast, calculations using the 1/N expansion reveal anomalies that spoil the conservation of the quantum non-local charges in the CPN−1=SU(N)/SU(N−1)×U(1) models for N>2, and in the wider class of theories based on the complex Grassmannians SU(N)/SU(n)×SU(N−n)×U(1) for N>n>1 [9].

446,446,"However, the measured reflectivity is less than the predicted value (∼96%), which is likely to relate to, amongst other factors, the roughness of the GaN/AlN interfaces particularly for the first layer in the DBR stack and the non-uniformity of the DBR layer thicknesses. Using STEM measurements of the thickness of each layer (on the a-plane) through the thickness of the stack, we calculate a new model (green curve) in which the overall reflectivity is reduced to 85%. This implies that variations in layer thickness through the stack are the main source of the reduced reflectivity in comparison to the model. In fact, a closer look at the cross-sectional STEM data and a careful extraction of layer thickness have revealed that whilst the layer thicknesses are fairly consistent through the DBR stack in the wing regions, there is a monotonic variation in the measured layer thicknesses in the window regions. (The GaN layer width smoothly increases, while the AlN layer thickness decreases through the DBR stack.). This observation could potentially be of practical importance, for samples grown on templates with a uniform defect density, as one could achieve much better reflectivities simply by altering the growth time to counteract the change in growth rate. This possibility is the subject of ongoing investigations. In addition, the presence of cracks and trenches in the top surface may also reduce the measured reflectivity further.

It includes the following contributions: (i) between the macroscopic Si tip of conical shape with the sphere of radius R at the end [27] and semi-infinite substrate; (ii) the dispersion forces between the atoms in the sample treated atomistically; and (iii) the interaction between the macroscopic part of the tip and the sample atoms. The first contribution is calculated analytically [27]. In fact, the macroscopic contribution to the van der Waals force is the same in each of the three systems described below, as it depends only on the tip–surface separation, macroscopic sphere radius, cone-angle and Hamaker constant of the system [27]. All these quantities are identical in each system we look at, so that the van der Waals force acts as a background attractive force independent of the microscopic properties of the system [8]. The Hamaker constant needed for the calculation of the macroscopic van der Waals force is estimated to be 0.5eV [32].

448,448,"This figure demonstrates that changes in the measure of bitumen content create sizable differences in the stiffness modulus of asphaltic samples that include waste glass cullet. As the percentage of glass increases, the measure of the stiffness modulus of modified asphalt increases too. But with pass of optimum measure of glass the stiffness modulus of asphaltic samples decrease. This trend in total of percentages of bitumen content is existing. Due to that waste glass cullet has no suction; the trend does not extend to measuring the stiffness modulus of asphaltic samples including waste glass cullet with different percentage of bitumen content. Glass particles do not absorb any bituminous material, so it is necessary to decrease the bitumen content with the addition of glass cullet. According to Fig. 2 and the results of the Marshall tests, the optimum bitumen measures decrease significantly in samples that include higher percentages of waste glass cullet. As the percentage of optimum bitumen content is 1% more in samples without waste glass cullet in comparison with saphaltic samples that include 20% waste glass cullet. The stiffness modulus of asphaltic samples that include waste glass cullet increased due to additional interlocking between the aggregate and the angularity of particles of glass cullet content. The increase in the intrusive friction angle because of the glass particles’ increased angularity is the main reason for the addition of the stiffness modulus of asphaltic samples that include waste glass cullet. But as the percentage of glass content reaches greater than 15%, the particles’ abundance cause slip these particles on together. The stiffness modulus of samples decreases as the percentage of glass cullet increases.

The demand to increase the service temperature of these alloys beyond 550°C (the typical temperature limit) requires careful study to understand the role that composition has on the oxidation behavior of Ti-based alloys [1–3]. The attempt to overcome this limitation in Ti-based alloys has led to the production of alloys with substantially improved oxidation resistance such as β-21S and also development of coatings and pre-oxidation techniques [1,4–6]. While it is tempting to extrapolate the oxidation behavior (e.g. oxidation rate law, depth of oxygen ingress and scale thickness) observed for a limited number of compositions under a certain oxidation condition to a broader compositional range, there are numerous examples in the literature where deviations from the expected relations are observed [7,8].

Furthermore, it is important to remark that the immersed structure stresses are captured in the Lagrangian description and hence, in order to compute them accurately, it is important to ensure that these spurious oscillations are not introduced via the kernel interpolation functions. In this paper, the authors have specifically designed a new family of kernel functions which do not introduce these spurious oscillations. The kernel functions are obtained by taking into account discrete reproducibility conditions as originally introduced by Peskin [14] (in our case, tailor-made for Cartesian staggered grids) and regularity requirements to prevent the appearance of spurious oscillations when computing derivatives. A Maple computer program has been developed to obtain explicit expressions for the new kernels.

Future work may consider investigating whether the algorithm would be as successful or not in solving variants of the MPSP that include more operational constraints, such as variable cut-off grade, grade blending, and stockpiling, as it is in solving the “classical” variant considered in this paper. Indeed, it is a general-purpose algorithm and should be applicable to any of these variants. Other research avenues include considering other strategies for updating the penalties within PH and other methods for solving the sub-problems. Finally, another important research direction is the development of other efficient solution approaches.

The equivalence of these methods under the weakly penalized regime, allows us to combine and take advantage of the good characteristics of each method. For instance, the weakly penalized formulation combines the simplified structure of the penalty method with the convergence characteristics of the PL formulation. However, due to the stiffness of the linear system at high values of the bulk modulus, the penalized formulations (classic penalty/weakly penalized) exhibit deteriorated nonlinear convergence. This stands in stark contrast to the PL method which (for inf–sup stable schemes) exhibits fast convergence even for high bulk modulus. However, we observe that, when the choice of πh provides equivalence with the discrete PL method, poor nonlinear convergence is observed though, in principle, the convergence should be similar. Examining the update formulae for both weakly penalized and PL approaches (see Appendix C), we observe that deteriorated convergence stems from: (1) initial residual amplification, and (2) the amplification of the residual.

Depending on the change in sign the chirped laser pulses, fragmentation could be either enhanced or suppressed [14,18,22]. Controlling the outcome of such laser induced molecular fragmentation with chirped femtosecond laser pulses has brought forth a number of experimental and theoretical effects in the recent years. However, efforts are continuing for a specific fragment channel enhancement, which is difficult since it also is a function of the molecular system under study [20,22–24]. Here we report the observation of a coherently enhanced fragmentation pathway of n-propyl benzene, which seems to have such specific fragmentation channel available. We found that for n-propyl benzene, the relative yield of C3H3+ is extremely sensitive to the phase of the laser pulse as compared to any of the other possible channels. In fact, there is almost an order of magnitude enhancement in the yield of C3H3+ when negatively chirped pulses are used, while there is no effect with the positive chirp. Moreover, the relative yield of all the other heavier fragment ions resulting from interaction of the strong field with the molecule is not sensitive to the sign of the chirp, within the noise level.

461,461,"Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) methods are a powerful approach to designing solvers for large-scale problems in computational mechanics. The numerical simulation problem is subdivided into a number of independent sub-problems, which are then coupled in appropriate ways. NURBS- (Non-Uniform Rational B-spline) based isogeometric analysis (IGA) applied to complex geometries requires to represent the computational domain as a collection of several NURBS geometries. Since there is a natural decomposition of the computational domain into several subdomains, NURBS-based IGA is particularly well suited for using FETI methods.This paper proposes the new IsogEometric Tearing and Interconnecting (IETI) method, which combines the advanced solver design of FETI with the exact geometry representation of IGA. We describe the IETI framework for two classes of simple model problems (Poisson and linearized elasticity) and discuss the coupling of the subdomains along interfaces (both for matching interfaces and for interfaces with T-joints, i.e. hanging nodes).

462,462,"Recent astronomical observations of high redshift type Ia supernovae performed by two groups [1–3] as well as the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the BOOMERANG [4] and MAXIMA-1 [5] experiments seem to indicate that at present the Universe is in a state of accelerated expansion. If one analyzes these data within the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) standard model of cosmology their most natural interpretation is that the Universe is spatially flat and that the (baryonic plus dark) matter density ρ is about one third of the critical density ρcrit. Most interestingly, the dominant contribution to the energy density is provided by the cosmological constant Λ. The vacuum energy density (1.1)ρΛ≡Λ/(8πG) is about twice as large as ρ, i.e., about two thirds of the critical density. With ΩM≡ρ/ρcrit, ΩΛ≡ρΛ/ρcrit and Ωtot≡ΩM+ΩΛ: (1.2)ΩM≈1/3,ΩΛ≈2/3,Ωtot≈1. This implies that the deceleration parameter q is approximately −1/2. While originally the cosmological constant problem [6] was related to the question why Λ is so unnaturally small, the discovery of the important role played by ρΛ has shifted the emphasis toward the “coincidence problem”, the question why ρ and ρΛ happen to be of the same order of magnitude precisely at this very moment [7].

463,463,"Global optimisation algorithms are used in this study to solve the optimisation problem as they are known to be efficient in incorporating statistical information and dealing with complicated objective functions that have multiple local minima/maxima. The genetic algorithm (GA) is such a global optimisation technique that mimics biological evolution processes and is used in this particular study. The algorithm starts with a random selection of a population from the decision variable domain (X). The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies this population. At each step, the algorithm selects a group of individual values from the population (parent) which are evolved through crossover or mutation to produce members of the next generation. This process is repeated for several generations until an optimum solution is reached. See [19] for a fuller description of the GA.

464,464,"The charmonium production has long been considered as a good process for investigating both perturbative and nonperturbative properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), because of the relatively large difference between the scale at which the charm–quark pair is produced at the parton level and the scale at which it evolves into a quarkonium. In particular, comparing to hadron colliders, e+e− colliders, provide a cleaner environment to study the charmonium productions and decays. However, some puzzles arise from the recent measurements on the prompt J/ψ productions at BaBar and Belle [1–3]. For the inclusive J/ψ productions, the cross section is much larger than the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) [4]; there is also an over-abundance of the four-charm–quark processes including the exclusive J/ψ and charmonium productions; there is no apparent signal in the hard J/ψ spectrum which has been predicted by the J/ψgg production mode as well as the color-octet mechanism in NRQCD. To provide plausible solutions and explanations for these conflicts, theorists have studied the possibilities of the contribution from two-virtual-photon mediate processes [5], large higher-order QCD corrections [6,7], collinear suppression at the end-point region of the J/ψ momentum [7,8], contribution from the J/ψ-glueball associated production [9] and contribution from a very light scalar boson [10].

465,465,"In this paper, we present our experimental observations on how solvents can vary the TPA and TPF properties of fluorescent rhodamine (Rh) dyes Rh6G, RhB and Rh101. Rhodamines are well-known xanthenes dyes, which have been extensively used for many widespread applications in single-molecule detection [24], DNA-sequence determination [25], fluorescence labelling [26], etc. due to their strong fluorescence over the visible spectral region. Molecular geometries of rhodamine dyes are well-known [27,28] and indicate that all the structures are non-centrosymmetric. In general, for centrosymmetric molecules, TPA is forbidden when tuned to the transitions at one-half of the excitation frequencies. However, for non-centrosymmetric molecules due to symmetry relaxations, the single-photon absorption (SPA) peaks and TPA peaks may coincide. So we set our primary aim to find the effect of solvent polarity on the correlation of SPA and TPA peaks for all the dyes.

466,466,"The second stress state is a tri-axial tensile stress designed to represent the zone ahead of an advancing crack tip. Micro-scale lateral cracks have been observed in the oxide layer, and appear to form very close to or at the metal–oxide interface (Fig. 1). Finite element analysis by Parise et al. indicated that these cracks form as a result of localised tensile stresses above peaks in the metal–oxide interface roughness [31]. These cracks are considered separate to any nano-scale cracks that might result from the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation. An assumption is made here that whether the micro-scale lateral cracks form via fracture of the oxide or by de-bonding at the interface a triaxial tensile stress state will still be present. In manufactured partially stabilised zirconia cracks would be expected to destabilise the tetragonal phase. This is simulated by applying tensile stress in direction 1, 2 and 3. As this the maximum stress at the crack tip is not known, the applied tensile stresses cover a range from 0.1GPa up to a maximum stress value of 2.2GPa as it is approximately equal to three times the fracture strength of bulk fracture strength for manufactured stabilized zirconia [34]. For the biaxial compressive and triaxial tensile stress states it is the trends in behaviour rather than the absolute values that are considered of greatest importance for this work.

467,467,"The Discrete Element Method applied to spheres is well established as a reasonably realistic tool, in a wide range of engineering disciplines, for modelling packing and flow of granular materials; Asmar et al. [8] describes the fundamentals of this method as applied by code developed in-house at Nottingham; since these are widely documented the details are not reproduced here, simply a summary. It applies an explicit time stepping approach to numerically integrate the translational and rotational motion of each particle from the resulting forces and moments acting on them at each timestep. The inter-particle and particle wall contacts are modelled using the linear spring–dashpot–slider analogy. Contact forces are modelled in the normal and tangential directions with respect to the line connecting the particles centres. Particle elastic stiffness is set so sphere “overlap” is not significant and moderate contact damping is applied. Particle cohesion can also be modelled but is assumed to be negligible in the current study. The translational and rotational motion of each particle is modelled using a half step leap-frog Verlet numerical integration scheme to update particle positions and velocities. Near-neighbour lists are used to increase the computational efficiency of determining particle contacts and a zoning method is used each time the list is composed; that is the system is divided into cubic regions, each particle centre is within one zone, and potential contacting particles are within the same or next-door neighbour zones. Full details are given in Asmar et al. [8].

468,468,"The viscoelastic behavior of elastomers containing small amounts of unattached chains has been investigated to characterize the dynamics of the polymer chains trapped in fixed networks [66–68]. Polymer chains trapped in fixed networks constitute a simpler system for the study of the polymer chain dynamics than the corresponding uncrosslinked polymer melts. This is because the complicated effect of the motion of the surrounding chains on the dynamics of the probe chain – called “constraint release” [69] – is absent in the fixed network systems. Most of the earlier studies employed randomly crosslinked elastomers as host networks. In this case, precise control of the mesh size of the host networks is not possible, and the mesh size has a broad distribution. The end-linking systems give the host networks a more uniform mesh size, and they can control the mesh size by the size of the precursor chains. We investigated the dynamic viscoelasticity of end-linked PDMS elastomers containing unattached linear PDMS as functions of the size of the unattached chains (Mg) and the network mesh (Mx) (Fig. 9a) [70]. We employed two types of host networks with Mx>Me and Mx<Me where Me (≈10,000 for PDMS) is the molecular mass between adjacent entanglements in the molten state. The Mx>Me and Mx<Me networks (designated as NL and NS, respectively) were designed by end-linking the long (Mn=84,000) and short precursor chains (Mn=4,550), respectively. The mesh of the NL networks is dominated by trapped entanglements, while that of the NS network is governed by chemical cross-links.

470,470,"In representing wetland-river interactions involving GIWs, many models assume that the wetland can discharge into a river but cannot receive overbank flows from it. In such models, the volume of water (or water level elevation) in a wetland and its corresponding threshold value (predominantly controlled by outlet elevation) are the prime determinants of wetland outflow (Feng et al., 2012; Hammer and Kadlec, 1986; Johnson et al., 2010; Kadlec and Wallace, 2009; Powell et al., 2008; Voldseth et al., 2007; Wen et al., 2013; Zhang and Mitsch, 2005). However, in regions characterised by widespread riparian wetlands that are hydraulically connected with adjacent rivers, wetland-river interaction is likely to be bidirectional. Such interactions should be quantified according to hydraulic principles involving relative river and wetland water level elevations as well as the properties of the connection between the two (Kouwen, 2013; Liu et al., 2008; Min et al., 2010; Nyarko, 2007; Restrepo et al., 1998). In the WATFLOOD model, for instance, riparian wetland-river interaction is modelled using the principle of Dupuit-Forchheimer lateral/radial groundwater flow (Kouwen, 2013). Since exchange between riparian wetlands and rivers can occur over the surface and/or through the subsurface, Restrepo et al. (1998) incorporated an equivalent transmissivity expression, obtained for wetland vegetation and the subsurface soil, into the Darcy flow equation of the MODFLOW model.

471,471,"Both methods of structure solution reveal a bent conformation of the central terthiophene units of the DOTT molecule as is clearly visible in all three cases in Figure 5. However, there is a fundamental difference in the conformation of the octyl side chains. Whilst for the single crystal phase at T=100K linearly extended chains are observed (Figure 5B), a defined rotation of the octyl chains relative to the terthiophene unit is found for the three thin film phases (Figure 5A). The rotation angle of about ±70° results from a twist of the first CC single bond at the link between the terthiophene unit and the octyl chain (see arrows Figure 5A). Two features of this rotated conformation are interesting. First, a molecule with rotated side chains represents the equilibrium state of an isolated single DOTT molecule as obtained by combined MD and VASP calculations [33]. Second, the rotated conformation of the octyl chains allows a dense packing of the octyl side chains for both molecules. Interestingly, the single crystal structure at room temperature shows the twisted as well as the linear conformation of the octyl side chains within one molecule (Figure 5C).

From a practical point of view, we have endowed the weighted additive model with a distance function structure, which takes negative values for points located outside the technology and non-negative values for points into the production possibility set. In this respect, the weighted additive distance function methodologically supports the branch of the literature that resorts to the weighted additive model or some related approach to measure productivity over time (see, for example, Mahlberg & Sahoo, 2011 or Chang et al., 2012). From a theoretical point of view, we have provided a new distance function with some interesting properties in contrast to the usual ones, mainly (1) when technical inefficiency has to be estimated, the weighted additive distance function coincides with the weighted additive model, which means that technical inefficiency is measured following the Pareto-Koopmans notion of efficiency; and (2) when productivity has to be determined and decomposed over time the weighted additive distance function emerges as an attractive tool to be used for cross-period evaluation of returns to scale changes, since this distance function is always feasible, even under Variable Returns to Scale.

474,474,"PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) has become by far the most popular material in the academic microfluidics community because it is inexpensive, easy to fabricate by replication of molds made using rapid prototyping or other techniques, flexible, optically transparent, biocompatible and its fabrication does not require high capital investment and cleanroom conditions. Various techniques have been adapted to fabricate microfluidic structures in PDMS, including wet and dry etching [20–22], photolithographic patterning of a photosensitive PDMS [23], and laser ablation [24]. But, it was the “soft-lithography” techniques [25] introduced by Whitesides et al. that enabled the widespread use of PDMS and opened up the era of PDMS-based microfluidics in the late 1990s. Replica molding, which is the casting of prepolymer against a master and generating a replica of the master in PDMS, has become a standard fabrication technique available in almost every research laboratory. Detailed overviews of soft-lithography techniques and their applications can be found from the reviews by McDonald et al. [26] and Sia et al. [27]. Nowadays, many tools dedicated for this purpose are available and can be purchased as a complete set (e.g. SoftLithoBox® provided by Elveflow (USA) [28]).

476,476,"The formulation in Table 1 was derived by an empirical approach and led to a non-classical glass matrix. Carter et al. [3] and Zhang et al. [4] took a more systematic approach to such glass-ceramic wasteforms. These wasteforms were targeted at Hanford K-basin sludges and the immobilisation of the primary waste stream from production of molybdenum-99 at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation site in Sydney respectively. In the work of Carter et al. and Zhang et al. the intended crystalline phase was the closely related titanate pyrochlore, CaUTi2O7. The glass matrix was formulated such that the trivalent species in the glass network, boron and aluminium, were charge compensated on a molar basis by sodium. The stoichiometric composition of the glass in this wasteform was Na2AlBSi6O16. This glass provides a method by which the glass composition can be varied systematically. Given that the initial observations inferred an important role played by alumina, it was decided to prepare a suite of zirconolite glass-ceramics in which the glass matrix was defined by Na2Al1+xB1–xSi6O16 to investigate the role played by glass composition in controlling crystalline phase stability. The x=1 end member gives the mineral albite, NaAlSi3O8. The melting point of albite is 1120°C [5] and the composition cools to a glass at the cooling rates that occur during a HIP cycle.

477,477,"A fully-coupled numerical framework for two-phase flows with an implicit implementation of surface tension has been introduced in this article. This fully-coupled framework has then been used to compare the influence of the surface tension treatment on the time-step restrictions resulting from capillary waves. The conducted study demonstrates that restrictions on the numerical time-step resulting from capillary waves are valid and unchanged regardless of the numerical treatment of surface tension. Since surface tension is not a function of pressure or velocity, the change in implementation does not affect the matrix coefficients of the primitive variables and, thus, numerical stability is independent of the treatment of surface tension. Further analysis shows that the capillary time-step constraint is a requirement imposed by the spatiotemporal sampling of capillary waves, which is independent of the applied numerical methodology.

In a majority of safety analyses the prediction of reactor physics responses is performed using neutron diffusion theory applied to three-dimensional systems, with inputs usually derived from deterministic neutron transport solutions of two-dimensional lattice geometries. There has been increased activity related to uncertainty and sensitivity in reactor physics calculations, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development – Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD-NEA) has sponsored an ongoing benchmark entitled “Uncertainty Analysis in Modelling” (UAM) related to these efforts.

479,479,"Gamma titanium aluminides are a family of low density, high performance alloys with the potential to replace current Ni-base superalloys used in the production of aero-engine components. Investment casting is one of the most economical methods to produce titanium and titanium aluminide alloy products, increasing the components' integrity and mechanical properties, whilst reducing material waste and machining cost [1]. Titanium aluminides are difficult to process mainly due to the low fluidity of the TiAl alloy around its melting temperature [2]. Due to the high affinity of elements such as oxygen, nitrogen etc., titanium and its alloys can easily interact with mould materials during the investment casting process, resulting in an interaction hardened layer being generated at the metal surface [3,4]. This hardened layer contains a large amount of dissolved oxygen, and it is very brittle and susceptible to crack generation and propagation [5].

There are two kinds of co-catalysts in terms of its function: one is for separation of electrons and the other is for separation of holes. The former representative co-catalysts are Pt, Fe3+, and Cu2+ [9–12]. It was reported that Fe3+ and Cu2+ were grafted as amorphous oxide cluster [9,10], and reduced into Fe2+ and Cu+ by receiving one electron, respectively [11,12]. The reduced metal oxide cluster with reduced ions could return into the original state by giving more than one electron to molecular oxygen. The latter ones are CoOx, CoPi (CoPOx), IrOx, and RuOx which are used for water oxidation, among which CoPi is reported to be the most effective co-catalyst for water oxidation [13]. However, there were few reports concerning co-grafting effects on photocatalytic activity especially in gaseous phase. We expected that by co-grafting of both co-catalysts for separations of electrons and holes, photocatalytic activity in gaseous phase would be further enhanced.

483,483,"DPD was first proposed in order to recover the properties of isotropy (and Galilean invariance) that were broken in the so-called lattice-gas automata method [5]. In DPD, each body is regarded as a coarse-grained particle. These particles interact in a soft (and short-ranged) potential, allowing larger integration timesteps than would be possible in MD, while simultaneously decreasing the number of degrees of freedom required. As in Langevin dynamics, a thermostat consisting of well-balanced damping and stochastic terms is applied to each particle. However, unlike in Langevin dynamics, both terms are pairwise and the damping term is based on relative velocities, leading to the conservation of both the angular momentum and the linear momentum. The property of Galilean invariance (i.e., the dependence on the relative velocity) makes DPD a profile-unbiased thermostat (PUT) [6,7] by construction and thus it is an ideal thermostat for nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) [8]. The momentum is expected to propagate locally (while global momentum is conserved) and thus the correct hydrodynamics is expected in DPD [8], as demonstrated previously in [9]. Due to the aforementioned properties, DPD has been widely used to recover thermodynamic, dynamical, and rheological properties of complex fluids, with applications in polymer solutions [10], colloidal suspensions [11], multiphase flows [12], and biological systems [13]. DPD has been compared with Langevin dynamics for out-of-equilibrium simulations of polymeric systems in [14], where as expected the correct dynamic fluctuations of the polymers were obtained with the former but not with the latter.

The use of advanced machine learning methods such as deep neural networks and muscles synergies extraction should also be investigated on problems under the influence of multiple dynamic factors as such methods may provide substantial improvements upon the utilized time-and-frequency EMG feature extraction methods (Diener, Janke, & Schultz, 2015; Ison, Vujaklija, Whitsell, Farina, & Artemiadis, 2016; Park & Lee, 2016).

Features such as the TD-PSD and the DFT proved more successful than others in reducing the impact of the two dynamic factors that we considered in this paper. Such features can be readily implemented into a prosthesis controller for real-time control, especially that the EMG pattern recognition systems are nowadays becoming available for clinical testing, e.g. the COAPT complete control system (Kuiken et al., 2014)11https://www.coaptengineering.com/.

485,485,"Powder metallurgy is a versatile technology for the manufacturing of components to (near) net-shape with high product quality. For a hardmetal (such as WC-Co) cold compaction of the powder to a “green body” is followed by liquid-phase sintering from the subsequent heating. This means that the binder metal Co is heated to melt in order to obtain sufficient mobility via capillary action, i.e., via surface traction, stemming from stored surface energy. The resulting flow causes gradual filling of the pore space and brings about a macroscopic shrinkage of the particle compact until a completely dense state is obtained, at least ideally. To model and quantitatively simulate the sintering process is a challenging task. The goal is to (i) estimate the final resulting quality (i.e., in terms of porosity) and (ii) to predict the final net shape and size of the sintered component.

486,486,"The test cases confirm that the high-order discretisation retains exponential convergence properties with increasing geometric and expansion polynomial order if both the solution and true surface are smooth. Errors are found to saturate when the geometric errors, due to the parametrisation of the surface elements, begin to dominate the temporal and spatial discretisation errors. For the smooth solutions considered as test cases, the results show that this dominance of geometric errors quickly limits the effectiveness of further increases in the number of degrees of freedom, either through mesh refinement or higher solution polynomial orders. Increasing the order of the geometry parametrisation reduces the geometric error. The analytic test cases presented here use a coarse curvilinear mesh; for applications, meshes are typically more refined in order to capture features in the solution and so will better capture the geometry and consequently reduce this lower bound on the solution error. If the solution is not smooth, we do not expect to see rapid convergence. In the case that the solution is smooth, but the true surface is not, then exponential convergence with P and Pg can only be achieved if, and only if, the discontinuities are aligned with element boundaries. However, if discontinuities lie within an element, convergence will be limited by the geometric approximation, since the true surface cannot be captured. In the cardiac problem, we consider both the true surface and solution to be smooth.

487,487,"SPM, and AFM in particular, has been widely applied to questions in polymer crystallization. The technique has several strengths that make it ideally suited for such studies. It is a high resolution technology, routinely resolving sub 10nm features [13,14], and hence allowing the fundamental length scale of the polymer lamellar crystal, its thickness, to be observed. AFM requires no staining or metal coating of the sample, so sample preparation is relatively straightforward. Also, it is non-destructive under many circumstances. This allows images to be obtained while a process such as crystal growth or melting is occurring, giving time-resolved data at lamellar or sub-lamellar resolution [15–18]. It is this final feature that provides many of the most exciting possibilities of AFM for studying polymer crystallization, as it is now possible to watch crystal growth, crystal melting, and re-organisations within crystals at the lamellar scale, seeing how structure evolves and local conditions influence kinetics. AFM has a wide range of different measuring modes, and, with the ever increasing number of functional semicrystalline polymers available (e.g. [19]), the breadth of experiments that can be carried out with a single machine is also one of the techniques attractions.

Full details of our vacuum-fabrication procedures have been given in previous publications [17–19,23]. Briefly, aluminium gate electrodes and associated tracks were vacuum evaporated onto the substrates through shadow masks. Subsequently, the substrates were attached to a cooled web-coater drum (Aerre Machines). With the drum rotating at a linear speed of 25m/min under vacuum, flash-evaporated TPGDA monomer vapour which condensed onto the substrates was cross-linked by exposure, in situ, to a plasma. The resulting smooth, pinhole-free films were typically 500nm to 1μm thick with a measured dielectric constant varying in the range 4–5. For circuit fabrication, the insulator was patterned using shadow masks to define rectangular areas separated by 1mm gaps to act as vias for inter-layer metallic connections. The substrates were then transferred into an evaporator (Minispectros, Kurt Lesker) integrated into a nitrogen glovebox for the vacuum-deposition (2.4nm/min) of DNTT onto the insulator.

492,492,"MicroCT has been applied to AM parts in various forms. Some preliminary results demonstrating the visualization of defects including porosity in AM components were reported in [6]. In another study, the porosity structures in parts built with improper settings were investigated [7]. In this work, the average porosity ranged from 0.1–0.5%, and large pores were observed which followed the build direction and may be attributed to the electron beam raster and overlap pattern. This was followed by more recent reports of the porosity distribution as a function of build strategy for electron beam melted samples with average porosity < 0.2% [8]. In another study, similar porosity images from microCT were reported at levels above 0.2% average porosity [9,10]. Very recent work reports similar images and may indicate that the porosity structure depends on the build direction [11]. Other applications of the use of microCT to characterize AM parts include the comparison of the part to its design model [12] and the characterization of surface roughness of such parts [13]. In the present work, the aim is to demonstrate a specific type of defect present at very low average porosity levels below 0.01%, and which does not follow the build direction as in some other reported examples. We also demonstrate how this porosity structure changes after Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) treatment of the same sample.
